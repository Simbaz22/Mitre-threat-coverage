title: ESCU - Linux Possible Ssh Key File Creation - Rule
description: This analytic is to look for possible ssh key file creation on ~/.ssh/
  folder. This technique is commonly abused by threat actors and adversaries to gain
  persistence and privilege escalation to the targeted host. by creating ssh private
  and public key and passing the public key to the attacker server. threat actor can
  access remotely the machine using openssh daemon service.

title: ESCU - AWS IAM Failure Group Deletion - Rule
description: This detection identifies failure attempts to delete groups. We want
  to identify when a group is attempting to be deleted, but either access is denied,
  there is a conflict or there is no group. This is indicative of administrators performing
  an action, but also could be suspicious behavior occurring. Review parallel IAM
  events - recently added users, new groups and so forth.

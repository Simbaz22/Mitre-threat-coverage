title: ESCU - Windows Raw Access To Disk Volume Partition - Rule
description: This analytic is to look for suspicious raw access read to device disk
  partition of the host machine. This technique was seen in several attacks by adversaries
  or threat actor to wipe, encrypt or overwrite the boot sector of each partition
  as part of their impact payload for example the "hermeticwiper" malware. This detection
  is a good indicator that there is a process try to read or write on boot sector.

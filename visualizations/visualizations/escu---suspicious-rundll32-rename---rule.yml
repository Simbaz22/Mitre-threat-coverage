title: ESCU - Suspicious Rundll32 Rename - Rule
description: 'WARNING, this detection has been marked deprecated by the Splunk Threat
  Research team, this means that it will no longer be maintained or supported. If
  you have any questions feel free to email us at: research@splunk.com. The following
  hunting analytic identifies renamed instances of rundll32.exe executing. rundll32.exe
  is natively found in C:\Windows\system32 and C:\Windows\syswow64. During investigation,
  validate it is the legitimate rundll32.exe executing and what script content it
  is loading. This query relies on the original filename or internal name from the
  PE meta data. Expand the query as needed by looking for specific command line arguments
  outlined in other analytics.'

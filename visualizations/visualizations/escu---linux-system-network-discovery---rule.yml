title: ESCU - Linux System Network Discovery - Rule
description: This analytic is to look for possible enumeration of local network configuration.
  This technique is commonly used as part of recon of adversaries or threat actor
  to know some network information for its next or further attack. This anomaly detections
  may capture normal event made by administrator during auditing or testing network
  connection of specific host or network to network.

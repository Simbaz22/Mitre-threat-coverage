title: ESCU - Detect HTML Help Spawn Child Process - Rule
description: The following analytic identifies hh.exe (HTML Help) execution of a Compiled
  HTML Help (CHM) that spawns a child process. This particular technique will load
  Windows script code from a compiled help file. CHM files may contain nearly any
  file type embedded, but only execute html/htm. Upon a successful execution, the
  following script engines may be used for execution - JScript, VBScript, VBScript.Encode,
  JScript.Encode, JScript.Compact. Analyst may identify vbscript.dll or jscript.dll
  loading into hh.exe upon execution. The "htm" and "html" file extensions were the
  only extensions observed to be supported for the execution of Shortcut commands
  or WSH script code. During investigation, identify script content origination. Review
  child process events and investigate further. hh.exe is natively found in C:\Windows\system32
  and C:\Windows\syswow64.

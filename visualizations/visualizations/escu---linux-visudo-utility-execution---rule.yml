title: ESCU - Linux Visudo Utility Execution - Rule
description: This analytic is to looks for suspicious commandline that add entry to
  /etc/sudoers by using visudo utility tool in linux platform. This technique may
  abuse by adversaries, malware author and red teamers to gain elevated privilege
  to targeted or compromised host. /etc/sudoers file controls who can run what commands
  as what users on what machines and can also control special things such as whether
  you need a password for particular commands. The file is composed of aliases (basically
  variables) and user specifications (which control who can run what).

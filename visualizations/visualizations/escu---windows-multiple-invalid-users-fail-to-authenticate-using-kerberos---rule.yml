title: ESCU - Windows Multiple Invalid Users Fail To Authenticate Using Kerberos -
  Rule
description: "The following analytic identifies one source endpoint failing to authenticate\
  \ with 30 unique invalid domain users using the Kerberos protocol. This behavior\
  \ could represent an adversary performing a Password Spraying attack against an\
  \ Active Directory environment using Kerberos to obtain initial access or elevate\
  \ privileges. Active Directory environments can be very different depending on the\
  \ organization. Users should test this detection and customize the arbitrary threshold\
  \ when needed. As attackers progress in a breach, mistakes will be made. In certain\
  \ scenarios, adversaries may execute a password spraying attack using an invalid\
  \ list of users. Event 4768 is generated every time the Key Distribution Center\
  \ issues a Kerberos Ticket Granting Ticket (TGT). Failure code 0x6 stands for client\
  \ not found in Kerberos database (the attempted user is not a valid domain user).\n\
  This logic can be used for real time security monitoring as well as threat hunting\
  \ exercises. This detection will only trigger on domain controllers, not on member\
  \ servers or workstations.\nThe analytics returned fields allow analysts to investigate\
  \ the event further by providing fields like source ip and attempted user accounts."

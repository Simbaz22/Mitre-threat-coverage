title: ESCU - Cobalt Strike Named Pipes - Rule
description: '"The following analytic identifies the use of default or publicly known
  named pipes used with Cobalt Strike. A named pipe is a named, one-way or duplex
  pipe for communication between the pipe server and one or more pipe clients. Cobalt
  Strike uses named pipes in many ways and has default values used with the Artifact
  Kit and Malleable C2 Profiles. The following query assists with identifying these
  default named pipes. Each EDR product presents named pipes a little different. Consider
  taking the values and generating a query based on the product of choice. Upon triage,
  review the process performing the named pipe. If it is explorer.exe, It is possible
  it was injected into by another process. Review recent parallel processes to identify
  suspicious patterns or behaviors. A parallel process may have a network connection,
  review and follow the connection back to identify any file modifications."'

title: ESCU - Excessive distinct processes from Windows Temp
description: This analytic will identify suspicious series of process executions.  We
  have observed that post exploit framework tools like Koadic and Meterpreter will
  launch an excessive number of processes with distinct file paths from Windows\Temp
  to execute actions on objective.  This behavior is extremely anomalous compared
  to typical application behaviors that use Windows\Temp.

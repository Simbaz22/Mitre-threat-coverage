title: ESCU - Spoolsv Spawning Rundll32 - Rule
description: The following analytic identifies a suspicious child process, `rundll32.exe`,
  with no command-line arguments being spawned from `spoolsv.exe`. This was identified
  during our testing of CVE-2021-34527 previously (CVE-2021-1675) or PrintNightmare.
  Typically, this is not normal behavior for `spoolsv.exe` to spawn a process. During
  triage, isolate the endpoint and review for source of exploitation. Capture any
  additional file modification events.

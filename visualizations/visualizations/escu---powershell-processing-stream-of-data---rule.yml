title: ESCU - Powershell Processing Stream Of Data - Rule
description: The following analytic identifies suspicious PowerShell script execution
  via EventCode 4104 that is processing compressed stream data. This is typically
  found in obfuscated PowerShell or PowerShell executing embedded .NET or binary files
  that are stream flattened and will be deflated durnig execution. During triage,
  review parallel processes within the same timeframe. Review the full script block
  to identify other related artifacts.

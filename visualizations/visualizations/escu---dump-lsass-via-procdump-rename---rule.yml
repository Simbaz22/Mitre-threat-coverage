title: ESCU - Dump LSASS via procdump Rename - Rule
description: "WARNING, this detection has been marked deprecated by the Splunk Threat\
  \ Research team, this means that it will no longer be maintained or supported. If\
  \ you have any questions feel free to email us at: research@splunk.com. Detect a\
  \ renamed instance of procdump.exe dumping the lsass process. This query looks for\
  \ both -mm and -ma usage. -mm will produce a mini dump file and -ma will write a\
  \ dump file with all process memory. Both are highly suspect and should be reviewed.\
  \ Modify the query as needed.\nDuring triage, confirm this is procdump.exe executing.\
  \ If it is the first time a Sysinternals utility has been ran, it is possible there\
  \ will be a -accepteula on the command line. Review other endpoint data sources\
  \ for cross process (injection) into lsass.exe."

title: ESCU - MSBuild Suspicious Spawned By Script Process - Rule
description: This analytic is to detect a suspicious child process of MSBuild spawned
  by Windows Script Host - cscript or wscript. This behavior or event are commonly
  seen and used by malware or adversaries to execute malicious msbuild process using
  malicious script in the compromised host. During triage, review parallel processes
  and identify any file modifications. MSBuild may load a script from the same path
  without having command-line arguments.

title: ESCU - Active Setup Registry Autostart
description: This analytic is to detect a suspicious modification of the active setup
  registry for persistence and privilege escalation. This technique was seen in several
  malware (poisonIvy), adware and APT to gain persistence to the compromised machine
  upon boot up. This TTP is a good indicator to further check the process id that
  do the modification since modification of this registry is not commonly done. check
  the legitimacy of the file and process involve in this rules to check if it is a
  valid setup installer that creating or modifying this registry.

description: This analytic looks for the execution of `whoami.exe` without any arguments.
  This windows native binary prints out the current logged user. Red Teams and adversaries
  alike may leverage `whoami.exe` to identify system users on a compromised endpoint
  for situational awareness and Active Directory Discovery.

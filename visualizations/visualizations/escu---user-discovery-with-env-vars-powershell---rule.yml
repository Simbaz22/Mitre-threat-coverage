title: ESCU - User Discovery With Env Vars PowerShell - Rule
description: This analytic looks for the execution of `powershell.exe` with command-line
  arguments that leverage PowerShell environment variables to identify the current
  logged user. Red Teams and adversaries may leverage this method to identify the
  logged user on a compromised endpoint for situational awareness and Active Directory
  Discovery.

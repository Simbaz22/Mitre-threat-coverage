title: ESCU - Powershell Remote Thread To Known Windows Process - Rule
description: this search is designed to detect suspicious powershell process that
  tries to inject code and to known/critical windows process and execute it using
  CreateRemoteThread. This technique is seen in several malware like trickbot and
  offensive tooling like cobaltstrike where it load a shellcode to svchost.exe to
  execute reverse shell to c2 and download another payload

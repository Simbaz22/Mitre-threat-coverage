description: 'WARNING, this detection has been marked deprecated by the Splunk Threat
  Research team, this means that it will no longer be maintained or supported. If
  you have any questions feel free to email us at: research@splunk.com. This search
  provides detection of possible GCP Oauth token abuse. GCP Oauth token without time
  limit can be exfiltrated and reused for keeping access sessions alive without further
  control of authentication, allowing attackers to access and move laterally.'

title: ESCU - Detect Unauthorized Assets by MAC address - Rule
description: By populating the organization's assets within the assets_by_str.csv,
  we will be able to detect unauthorized devices that are trying to connect with the
  organization's network by inspecting DHCP request packets, which are issued by devices
  when they attempt to obtain an IP address from the DHCP server. The MAC address
  associated with the source of the DHCP request is checked against the list of known
  devices, and reports on those that are not found.

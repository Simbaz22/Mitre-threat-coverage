title: ESCU - NET Profiler UAC bypass - Rule
description: This search is to detect modification of registry to bypass UAC windows
  feature. This technique is to add a payload dll path on .NET COR file path that
  will be loaded by mmc.exe as soon it was executed. This detection rely on monitoring
  the registry key and values in the detection area. It may happened that windows
  update some dll related to mmc.exe and add dll path in this registry. In this case
  filtering is needed.

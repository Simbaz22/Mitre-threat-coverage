title: ESCU - PowerShell Loading DotNET into Memory via Reflection - Rule
description: "The following analytic utilizes PowerShell Script Block Logging (EventCode=4104)\
  \ to identify suspicious PowerShell execution. Script Block Logging captures the\
  \ command sent to PowerShell, the full command to be executed. Upon enabling, logs\
  \ will output to Windows event logs. Dependent upon volume, enable no critical endpoints\
  \ or all. \nThis analytic identifies the use of PowerShell loading .net assembly\
  \ via reflection. This is commonly found in malicious PowerShell usage, including\
  \ Empire and Cobalt Strike. In addition, the `load(` value may be modifed by removing\
  \ `(` and it will identify more events to review. \nDuring triage, review parallel\
  \ processes using an EDR product or 4688 events. It will be important to understand\
  \ the timeline of events around this activity. Review the entire logged PowerShell\
  \ script block."

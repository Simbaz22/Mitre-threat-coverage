title: ESCU - Domain Group Discovery With Net
description: This analytic looks for the execution of `net.exe` with command-line
  arguments utilized to query for domain groups. The argument `group /domain`, returns
  a list of all domain groups. Red Teams and adversaries alike use net.exe to enumerate
  domain groups for situational awareness and Active Directory Discovery.

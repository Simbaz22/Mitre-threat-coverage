title: ESCU - Windows Defender Exclusion Registry Entry - Rule
description: This analytic will detect a suspicious process that modify a registry
  related to windows defender exclusion feature. This registry is abused by adversaries,
  malware author and red teams to bypassed Windows Defender Anti-Virus product by
  excluding folder path, file path, process, extensions and etc. from its real time
  or schedule scan to execute their malicious code. This is a good indicator for a
  defense evasion and to look further for events after this behavior.

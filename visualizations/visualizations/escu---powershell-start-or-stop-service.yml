title: ESCU - PowerShell Start or Stop Service
description: "This analytic identifies the use of PowerShell's Start-Service or Stop-Service\
  \ cmdlets on an endpoint. These cmdlets allow users to start or stop a specified\
  \ Windows service. The ability to manipulate services can be leveraged by attackers\
  \ to disable or stop critical services, which can cause system instability or disrupt\
  \ business operations.\n  By detecting the use of Start-Service or Stop-Service\
  \ cmdlets via PowerShell, this analytic can help organizations identify potential\
  \ malicious activity related to attackers attempting to manipulate services on compromised\
  \ systems. However, note that this behavior may be noisy, as these cmdlets are commonly\
  \ used by system administrators or other legitimate users to manage services. Therefore,\
  \ it is recommended not to enable this analytic as a direct notable or TTP. Instead,\
  \ it should be used as part of a broader set of security controls to detect and\
  \ investigate potential threats."

title: ESCU - Linux Possible Access To Sudoers File - Rule
description: This analytic is to detect a possible access or modification of /etc/sudoers
  file. "/etc/sudoers" file controls who can run what command as what users on what
  machine and can also control whether a specific user need a password for particular
  commands.  adversaries and threat actors abuse this file to gain persistence and/or
  privilege escalation during attack on targeted host.

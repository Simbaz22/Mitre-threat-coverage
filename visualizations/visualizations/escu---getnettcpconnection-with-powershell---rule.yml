description: This analytic looks for the execution of `powershell.exe` with command-line
  utilized to get a listing of network connections on a compromised system. The `Get-NetTcpConnection`
  commandlet lists the current TCP connections. Red Teams and adversaries alike may
  use this commandlet for situational awareness and Active Directory Discovery.

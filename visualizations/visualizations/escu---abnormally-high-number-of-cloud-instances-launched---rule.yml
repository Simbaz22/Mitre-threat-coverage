title: ESCU - Abnormally High Number Of Cloud Instances Launched - Rule
description: This search finds for the number successfully created cloud instances
  for every 4 hour block. This is split up between weekdays and the weekend. It then
  applies the probability densitiy model previously created and alerts on any outliers.

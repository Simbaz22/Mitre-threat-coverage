title: ESCU - Detect Copy of ShadowCopy with Script Block Logging - Rule
description: '"The following analytic utilizes PowerShell Script Block Logging (EventCode=4104)
  to identify suspicious PowerShell execution. Script Block Logging captures the command
  sent to PowerShell, the full command to be executed. Upon enabling, logs will output
  to Windows event logs. Dependent upon volume, enable on critical endpoints or all.
  This analytic identifies `copy` or `[System.IO.File]::Copy` being used to capture
  the SAM, SYSTEM or SECURITY hives identified in script block. This will catch the
  most basic use cases for credentials being taken for offline cracking. During triage,
  review parallel processes using an EDR product or 4688 events. It will be important
  to understand the timeline of events around this activity. Review the entire logged
  PowerShell script block."'

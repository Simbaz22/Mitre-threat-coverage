title: ESCU - Detect API activity from users without MFA - Rule
description: 'WARNING, this detection has been marked deprecated by the Splunk Threat
  Research team, this means that it will no longer be maintained or supported. If
  you have any questions feel free to email us at: research@splunk.com. This search
  looks for AWS CloudTrail events where a user logged into the AWS account, is making
  API calls and has not enabled Multi Factor authentication. Multi factor authentication
  adds a layer of security by forcing the users to type a unique authentication code
  from an approved authentication device when they access AWS websites or services.
  AWS Best Practices recommend that you enable MFA for privileged IAM users.'

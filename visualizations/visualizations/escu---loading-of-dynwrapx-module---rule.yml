title: ESCU - Loading Of Dynwrapx Module - Rule
description: DynamicWrapperX is an ActiveX component that can be used in a script
  to call Windows API functions, but it requires the dynwrapx.dll to be installed
  and registered. With that, registering or loading dynwrapx.dll to a host is highly
  suspicious. In most instances when it is used maliciously, the best way to triage
  is to review parallel processes and pivot on the process_guid. Review the registry
  for any suspicious modifications meant to load dynwrapx.dll. Identify any suspicious
  module loads of dynwrapx.dll. This detection will return and identify the processes
  that invoke vbs/wscript/cscript.

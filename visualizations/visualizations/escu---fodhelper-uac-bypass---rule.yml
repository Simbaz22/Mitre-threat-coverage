title: ESCU - FodHelper UAC Bypass - Rule
description: "Fodhelper.exe has a known UAC bypass as it attempts to look for specific\
  \ registry keys upon execution, that do not exist. Therefore, an attacker can write\
  \ its malicious commands in these registry keys to be executed by fodhelper.exe\
  \ with the highest privilege. \n1. `HKCU:\\Software\\Classes\\ms-settings\\shell\\\
  open\\command`\n1. `HKCU:\\Software\\Classes\\ms-settings\\shell\\open\\command\\\
  DelegateExecute`\n1. `HKCU:\\Software\\Classes\\ms-settings\\shell\\open\\command\\\
  (default)`\nUpon triage, fodhelper.exe will have a child process and read access\
  \ will occur on the registry keys. Isolate the endpoint and review parallel processes\
  \ for additional behavior."

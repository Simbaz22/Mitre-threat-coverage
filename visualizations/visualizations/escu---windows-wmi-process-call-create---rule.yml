title: ESCU - Windows WMI Process Call Create - Rule
description: This analytic is to look for wmi commandlines to execute or create process.
  This technique was used by adversaries or threat actor to execute their malicious
  payload in local or remote host. This hunting query is a good pivot to start to
  look further which process trigger the wmi or what process it execute locally or
  remotely.

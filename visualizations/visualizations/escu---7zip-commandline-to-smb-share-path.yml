title: ESCU - 7zip CommandLine To SMB Share Path
description: This search is to detect a suspicious 7z process with commandline pointing
  to SMB network share. This technique was seen in CONTI LEAK tools where it use 7z
  to archive a sensitive files and place it in network share tmp folder. This search
  is a good hunting query that may give analyst a hint why specific user try to archive
  a file pointing to SMB user which is un usual.

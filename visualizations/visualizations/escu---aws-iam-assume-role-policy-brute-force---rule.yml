title: ESCU - AWS IAM Assume Role Policy Brute Force - Rule
description: The following detection identifies any malformed policy document exceptions
  with a status of `failure`. A malformed policy document exception occurs in instances
  where roles are attempted to be assumed, or brute forced. In a brute force attempt,
  using a tool like CloudSploit or Pacu, an attempt will look like `arn:aws:iam::111111111111:role/aws-service-role/rds.amazonaws.com/AWSServiceRoleForRDS`.  Meaning,
  when an adversary is attempting to identify a role name, multiple failures will
  occur. This detection focuses on the errors of a remote attempt that is failing.

title: ESCU - PowerShell Enable PowerShell Remoting
description: This analytic utilizes PowerShell Script Block Logging (EventCode 4104)
  to identify the use of Enable-PSRemoting cmdlet. This cmdlet allows users to enable
  PowerShell remoting on a local or remote computer, which allows other computers
  to run commands on the target computer. The ability to remotely execute commands
  can be abused by attackers to take control of compromised systems and pivot to other
  systems on the network. By detecting the use of Enable-PSRemoting cmdlet via script
  block logging, this analytic can help organizations identify potential malicious
  activity related to attackers attempting to gain remote control of compromised systems.

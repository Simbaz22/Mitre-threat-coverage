title: ESCU - Windows Disable Shutdown Button Through Registry - Rule
description: This analytic is to detect a suspicious registry modification to disable
  shutdown button on the logon user. This technique was seen in several malware especially
  in ransomware family like killdisk malware variant to make the compromised host
  un-useful and hard to remove other registry modification made on the machine that
  needs restart to take effect. This windows feature may implement by administrator
  in some server where shutdown is critical. In that scenario filter of machine and
  users that can modify this registry is needed.

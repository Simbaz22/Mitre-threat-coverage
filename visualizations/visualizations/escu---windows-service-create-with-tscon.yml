title: ESCU - Windows Service Create with Tscon
description: The following analytic detects potential RDP Hijacking attempts by monitoring
  a series of actions taken by an attacker to gain unauthorized access to a remote
  system. The attacker first runs the quser command to query the remote host for disconnected
  user sessions. Upon identifying a disconnected session, they use the sc.exe command
  to create a new Windows service with a binary path that launches tscon.exe. By specifying
  the disconnected session ID and a destination ID, the attacker can transfer the
  disconnected session to a new RDP session, effectively hijacking the user''s session.
  This analytic allows security teams to detect and respond to RDP Hijacking attempts,
  mitigating potential risks and impacts on targeted systems.

title: ESCU - Detect new user AWS Console Login - Rule
description: 'WARNING, this detection has been marked deprecated by the Splunk Threat
  Research team, this means that it will no longer be maintained or supported. If
  you have any questions feel free to email us at: research@splunk.com. This search
  looks for AWS CloudTrail events wherein a console login event by a user was recorded
  within the last hour, then compares the event to a lookup file of previously seen
  users (by ARN values) who have logged into the console. The alert is fired if the
  user has logged into the console for the first time within the last hour. Deprecated
  now this search is updated to use the Authentication datamodel.'

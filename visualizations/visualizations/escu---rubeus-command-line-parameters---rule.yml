title: ESCU - Rubeus Command Line Parameters - Rule
description: Rubeus is a C# toolset for raw Kerberos interaction and abuses. It is
  heavily adapted from Benjamin Delpys Kekeo project and Vincent LE TOUXs MakeMeEnterpriseAdmin
  project. This analytic looks for the use of Rubeus command line arguments utilized
  in common Kerberos attacks like exporting and importing tickets, forging silver
  and golden tickets, requesting a TGT or TGS, kerberoasting, password spraying, etc.
  Red teams and adversaries alike use Rubeus for Kerberos attacks within Active Directory
  networks. Defenders should be aware that adversaries may customize the source code
  of Rubeus and modify the command line parameters. This would effectively bypass
  this analytic.

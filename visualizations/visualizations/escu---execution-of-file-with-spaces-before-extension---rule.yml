title: ESCU - Execution of File With Spaces Before Extension - Rule
description: 'WARNING, this detection has been marked deprecated by the Splunk Threat
  Research team, this means that it will no longer be maintained or supported. If
  you have any questions feel free to email us at: research@splunk.com. This search
  looks for processes launched from files with at least five spaces in the name before
  the extension. This is typically done to obfuscate the file extension by pushing
  it outside of the default view.'

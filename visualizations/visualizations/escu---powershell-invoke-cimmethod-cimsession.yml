title: ESCU - PowerShell Invoke CIMMethod CIMSession
description: This analytic identifies the use of the New-CIMSession cmdlet being created
  along with the Invoke-CIMMethod cmdlet being used within PowerShell. This particular
  behavior is similar to the usage of the Invoke-WMIMethod cmdlet, which is known
  for executing WMI commands on targets using NTLMv2 pass-the-hash authentication.
  The New-CIMSession cmdlet allows users to create a new CIM session object for a
  specified computer system, which can then be used to execute CIM operations remotely.
  Similarly, the Invoke-CIMMethod cmdlet is used to invoke a specified method on one
  or more CIM objects. Therefore, the combination of New-CIMSession and Invoke-CIMMethod
  cmdlets in PowerShell can potentially indicate malicious behavior, and this analytic
  can help detect such activity.

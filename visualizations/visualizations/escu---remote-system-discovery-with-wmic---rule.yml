title: ESCU - Remote System Discovery with Wmic - Rule
description: This analytic looks for the execution of `wmic.exe` with command-line
  arguments utilized to discover remote systems. The arguments utilized in this command
  return a list of all the systems registered in the domain. Red Teams and adversaries
  alike may leverage WMI and wmic.exe to identify remote systems for situational awareness
  and Active Directory Discovery.

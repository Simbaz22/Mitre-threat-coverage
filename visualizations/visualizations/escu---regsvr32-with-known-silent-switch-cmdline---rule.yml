title: ESCU - Regsvr32 with Known Silent Switch Cmdline - Rule
description: The following analytic identifies Regsvr32.exe utilizing the silent switch
  to load DLLs. This technique has most recently been seen in IcedID campaigns to
  load its initial dll that will download the 2nd stage loader that will download
  and decrypt the config payload. The switch type may be either a hyphen `-` or forward
  slash `/`. This behavior is typically found with `-s`, and it is possible there
  are more switch types that may be used. \ During triage, review parallel processes
  and capture any artifacts that may have landed on disk. Isolate and contain the
  endpoint as necessary.

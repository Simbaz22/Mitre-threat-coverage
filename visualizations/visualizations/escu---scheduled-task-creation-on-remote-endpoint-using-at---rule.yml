title: ESCU - Scheduled Task Creation on Remote Endpoint using At - Rule
description: This analytic looks for the execution of `at.exe` with command-line arguments
  utilized to create a Scheduled Task on a remote endpoint. Red Teams and adversaries
  alike may abuse the Task Scheduler for lateral movement and remote code execution.
  The `at.exe` binary internally leverages the AT protocol which was deprecated starting
  with Windows 8 and Windows Server 2012 but may still work on previous versions of
  Windows. Furthermore, attackers may enable this protocol on demand by changing a
  sytem registry key.

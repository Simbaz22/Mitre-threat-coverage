title: ESCU - AWS IAM Successful Group Deletion - Rule
description: The following query uses IAM events to track the success of a group being
  deleted on AWS. This is typically not indicative of malicious behavior, but a precurser
  to additional events thay may unfold. Review parallel IAM events - recently added
  users, new groups and so forth. Inversely, review failed attempts in a similar manner.

title: ESCU - Windows System File on Disk - Rule
description: The following hunting analytic will assist with identifying new .sys
  files introduced in the environment. This query is meant to identify sys file creates
  on disk. There will be noise, but reducing common process names or applications
  should help to limit any volume. The idea is to identify new sys files written to
  disk and identify them before they're added as a new kernel mode driver.

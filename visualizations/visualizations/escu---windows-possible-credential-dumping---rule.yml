title: ESCU - Windows Possible Credential Dumping - Rule
description: '"The following analytic is an enhanced version of two previous analytics
  that identifies common GrantedAccess permission requests and CallTrace DLLs in order
  to detect credential dumping. GrantedAccess is the requested permissions by the
  SourceImage into the TargetImage. CallTrace Stack trace of where open process is
  called. Included is the DLL and the relative virtual address of the functions in
  the call stack right before the open process call. dbgcore.dll or dbghelp.dll are
  two core Windows debug DLLs that have minidump functions which provide a way for
  applications to produce crashdump files that contain a useful subset of the entire
  process context. The idea behind using ntdll.dll is to blend in by using native
  api of ntdll.dll. For example in sekurlsa module there are many ntdll exported api,
  like RtlCopyMemory, used to execute this module which is related to lsass dumping."'

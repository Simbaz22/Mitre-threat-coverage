title: ESCU - Windows Disable Change Password Through Registry - Rule
description: This analytic is to detect a suspicious registry modification to disable
  change password feature of the windows host. This registry modification may disables
  the Change Password button on the Windows Security dialog box (which appears when
  you press Ctrl+Alt+Del). As a result, users cannot change their Windows password
  on demand. This technique was seen in some malware family like ransomware to prevent
  the user to change the password after ownning the network or a system during attack.
  This windows feature may implemented by administrator to prevent normal user to
  change the password of a critical host or server, In this type of scenario filter
  is needed to minimized false positive.

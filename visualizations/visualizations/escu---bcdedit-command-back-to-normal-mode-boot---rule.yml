title: ESCU - Bcdedit Command Back To Normal Mode Boot - Rule
description: This search is to detect a suspicious bcdedit commandline to configure
  the host from safe mode back to normal boot configuration. This technique was seen
  in blackMatter ransomware where it force the compromised host to boot in safe mode
  to continue its encryption and bring back to normal boot using bcdedit deletevalue
  command. This TTP can be a good alert for host that booted from safe mode forcefully
  since it need to modify the boot configuration to bring it back to normal.

title: ESCU - Get WMIObject Group Discovery - Rule
description: The following hunting analytic identifies the use of `Get-WMIObject Win32_Group`
  being used with PowerShell to identify local groups on the endpoint. \ Typically,
  by itself, is not malicious but may raise suspicion based on time of day, endpoint
  and username. \ During triage, review parallel processes and identify any further
  suspicious behavior.

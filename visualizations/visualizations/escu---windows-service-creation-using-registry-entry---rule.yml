title: ESCU - Windows Service Creation Using Registry Entry - Rule
description: This analytic is to look for suspicious modification or creation of registry
  to have service entry. This technique is abused by adversaries or threat actor to
  persist, gain privileges in the machine or even lateral movement. This technique
  can be executed using reg.exe application or using windows API like for example
  the CrashOveride malware. This detection is a good indicator that a process is trying
  to create a service entry using registry ImagePath.

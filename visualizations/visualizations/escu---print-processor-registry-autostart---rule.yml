title: ESCU - Print Processor Registry Autostart - Rule
description: This analytic is to detect a suspicious modification or new registry
  entry regarding print processor. This registry is known to be abuse by turla or
  other APT to gain persistence and privilege escalation to the compromised machine.
  This is done by adding the malicious dll payload on the new created key in this
  registry that will be executed as it restarted the spoolsv.exe process and services.

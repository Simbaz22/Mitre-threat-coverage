title: ESCU - Detect SharpHound File Modifications - Rule
description: SharpHound is used as a reconnaissance collector, ingestor, for BloodHound.
  SharpHound will query the domain controller and begin gathering all the data related
  to the domain and trusts. For output, it will drop a .zip file upon completion following
  a typical pattern that is often not changed. This analytic focuses on the default
  file name scheme. Note that this may be evaded with different parameters within
  SharpHound, but that depends on the operator. `-randomizefilenames` and `-encryptzip`
  are two examples. In addition, executing SharpHound via .exe or .ps1 without any
  command-line arguments will still perform activity and dump output to the default
  filename. Example default filename `20210601181553_BloodHound.zip`. SharpHound creates
  multiple temp files following the same pattern `20210601182121_computers.json`,
  `domains.json`, `gpos.json`, `ous.json` and `users.json`. Tuning may be required,
  or remove these json's entirely if it is too noisy. During traige, review parallel
  processes for further suspicious behavior. Typically, the process executing the
  `.ps1` ingestor will be PowerShell.

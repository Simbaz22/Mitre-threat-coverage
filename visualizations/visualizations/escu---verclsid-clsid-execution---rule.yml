title: ESCU - Verclsid CLSID Execution - Rule
description: This analytic is to detect a possible abuse of verclsid to execute malicious
  file through generate CLSID. This process is a normal application of windows to
  verify the CLSID COM object before it is instantiated by Windows Explorer. This
  hunting query can be a good pivot point to analyze what is he CLSID or COM object
  pointing too to check if it is a valid application or not.

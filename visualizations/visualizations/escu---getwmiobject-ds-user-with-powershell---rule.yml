title: ESCU - GetWmiObject DS User with PowerShell - Rule
description: This analytic looks for the execution of `powershell.exe` with command-line
  arguments utilized to query for domain users. The `Get-WmiObject` commandlet combined
  with the `-class ds_user` parameter can be used to return the full list of users
  in a Windows domain. Red Teams and adversaries alike may leverage WMI in this case,
  using PowerShell, to enumerate domain users for situational awareness and Active
  Directory Discovery.

title: ESCU - Nishang PowershellTCPOneLine - Rule
description: This query detects the Nishang Invoke-PowerShellTCPOneLine utility that
  spawns a call back to a remote command and control server. This is a powershell
  oneliner. In addition, this will capture on the command-line additional utilities
  used by Nishang. Triage the endpoint and identify any parallel processes that look
  suspicious. Review the reputation of the remote IP or domain contacted by the powershell
  process.

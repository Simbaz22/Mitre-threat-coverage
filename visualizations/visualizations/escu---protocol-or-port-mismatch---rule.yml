title: ESCU - Protocol or Port Mismatch - Rule
description: This search looks for network traffic on common ports where a higher
  layer protocol does not match the port that is being used. For example, this search
  should identify cases where protocols other than HTTP are running on TCP port 80.
  This can be used by attackers to circumvent firewall restrictions, or as an attempt
  to hide malicious communications over ports and protocols that are typically allowed
  and not well inspected.

notes: Too many FPs and we have another rule this is very similar and enabled.

title: ESCU - Detect Outbound LDAP Traffic - Rule
description: Malicious actors often abuse misconfigured LDAP servers or applications
  that use the LDAP servers in organizations. Outbound LDAP traffic should not be
  allowed outbound through your perimeter firewall.  This search will help determine
  if you have any LDAP connections to IP addresses outside of private (RFC1918) address
  space.

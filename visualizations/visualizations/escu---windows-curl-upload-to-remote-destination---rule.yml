title: ESCU - Windows Curl Upload to Remote Destination - Rule
description: "The following analytic identifies the use of Windows Curl.exe uploading\
  \ a file to a remote destination. \n`-T` or `--upload-file` is used when a file\
  \ is to be uploaded to a remotge destination. \n`-d` or `--data` POST is the HTTP\
  \ method that was invented to send data to a receiving web application, and it is,\
  \ for example, how most common HTML forms on the web work. \nHTTP multipart formposts\
  \ are done with `-F`, but this appears to not be compatible with the Windows version\
  \ of Curl. Will update if identified adversary tradecraft. \nAdversaries may use\
  \ one of the three methods based on the remote destination and what they are attempting\
  \ to upload (zip vs txt). During triage, review parallel processes for further behavior.\
  \ In addition, identify if the upload was successful in network logs. If a file\
  \ was uploaded, isolate the endpoint and review."

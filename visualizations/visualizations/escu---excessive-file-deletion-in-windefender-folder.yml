title: ESCU - Excessive File Deletion In WinDefender Folder
description: This analytic will identify excessive file deletion events in the Windows
  Defender folder. This technique was seen in the WhisperGate malware campaign in
  which adversaries abused Nirsofts advancedrun.exe to gain administrative privilege
  to then execute PowerShell commands to delete files within the Windows Defender
  application folder. This behavior is a good indicator the offending process is trying
  to corrupt a Windows Defender installation.

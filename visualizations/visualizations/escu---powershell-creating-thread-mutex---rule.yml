title: ESCU - Powershell Creating Thread Mutex - Rule
description: The following analytic identifies suspicious PowerShell script execution
  via EventCode 4104 that is using the `mutex` function. This function is commonly
  seen in some obfuscated PowerShell scripts to make sure that only one instance of
  there process is running on a compromise machine. During triage, review parallel
  processes within the same timeframe. Review the full script block to identify other
  related artifacts.

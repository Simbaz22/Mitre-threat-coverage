description: This analytic looks for the execution of `powershell.exe` with command-line
  arguments utilized to query for domain groups. `Get-DomainGroup` is part of PowerView,
  a PowerShell tool used to perform enumeration on Windows domains. Red Teams and
  adversaries alike may leverage PowerView to enumerate domain groups for situational
  awareness and Active Directory Discovery.

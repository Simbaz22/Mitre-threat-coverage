title: ESCU - BITS Job Persistence - Rule
description: The following query identifies Microsoft Background Intelligent Transfer
  Service utility `bitsadmin.exe` scheduling a BITS job to persist on an endpoint.
  The query identifies the parameters used to create, resume or add a file to a BITS
  job. Typically seen combined in a oneliner or ran in sequence. If identified, review
  the BITS job created and capture any files written to disk. It is possible for BITS
  to be used to upload files and this may require further network data analysis to
  identify. You can use `bitsadmin /list /verbose` to list out the jobs during investigation.

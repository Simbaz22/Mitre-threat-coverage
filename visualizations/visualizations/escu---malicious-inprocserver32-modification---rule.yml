title: ESCU - Malicious InProcServer32 Modification - Rule
description: The following analytic identifies a process modifying the registry with
  a known malicious CLSID under InProcServer32. Most COM classes are registered with
  the operating system and are identified by a GUID that represents the Class Identifier
  (CLSID) within the registry (usually under HKLM\\Software\\Classes\\CLSID or HKCU\\Software\\Classes\\CLSID).
  Behind the implementation of a COM class is the server (some binary) that is referenced
  within registry keys under the CLSID. The LocalServer32 key represents a path to
  an executable (exe) implementation, and the InprocServer32 key represents a path
  to a dynamic link library (DLL) implementation (Bohops). During triage, review parallel
  processes for suspicious activity. Pivot on the process GUID to see the full timeline
  of events. Analyze the value and look for file modifications. Being this is looking
  for inprocserver32, a DLL found in the value will most likely be loaded by a parallel
  process.

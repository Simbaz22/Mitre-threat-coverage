title: ESCU - ServicePrincipalNames Discovery with PowerShell - Rule
description: "The following analytic identifies `powershell.exe` usage, using Script\
  \ Block Logging EventCode 4104, related to querying the domain for Service Principle\
  \ Names. typically, this is a precursor activity related to kerberoasting or the\
  \ silver ticket attack. \nWhat is a ServicePrincipleName? \nA service principal\
  \ name (SPN) is a unique identifier of a service instance. SPNs are used by Kerberos\
  \ authentication to associate a service instance with a service logon account. This\
  \ allows a client application to request that the service authenticate an account\
  \ even if the client does not have the account name.\nThe following analytic identifies\
  \ the use of KerberosRequestorSecurityToken class within the script block. Using\
  \ .NET System.IdentityModel.Tokens.KerberosRequestorSecurityToken class in PowerShell\
  \ is the equivelant of using setspn.exe. \nDuring triage, review parallel processes\
  \ for further suspicious activity."

title: ESCU - PetitPotam Suspicious Kerberos TGT Request - Rule
description: The following analytic identifes Event Code 4768, A `Kerberos authentication
  ticket (TGT) was requested`, successfull occurs. This behavior has been identified
  to assist with detecting PetitPotam, CVE-2021-36942. Once an attacer obtains a computer
  certificate by abusing Active Directory Certificate Services in combination with
  PetitPotam, the next step would be to leverage the certificate for malicious purposes.
  One way of doing this is to request a Kerberos Ticket Granting Ticket using a tool
  like Rubeus. This request will generate a 4768 event with some unusual fields depending
  on the environment. This analytic will require tuning, we recommend filtering Account_Name
  to Domain Controllers for your environment.

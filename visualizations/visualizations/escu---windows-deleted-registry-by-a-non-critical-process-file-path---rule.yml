title: ESCU - Windows Deleted Registry By A Non Critical Process File Path - Rule
description: This analytic is to detect deletion of registry with suspicious process
  file path. This technique was seen in Double Zero wiper malware where it will delete
  all the subkey in HKLM, HKCU and HKU registry hive as part of its destructive payload
  to the targeted hosts. This anomaly detections can catch possible malware or advesaries
  deleting registry as part of defense evasion or even payload impact but can also
  catch for third party application updates or installation. In this scenario false
  positive filter is needed.

title: ESCU - GetWmiObject User Account with PowerShell - Rule
description: This analytic looks for the execution of `powershell.exe` with command-line
  arguments utilized to query local users. The `Get-WmiObject` commandlet combined
  with the `Win32_UserAccount` parameter is used to return a list of all local users.
  Red Teams and adversaries may leverage this commandlet to enumerate users for situational
  awareness and Active Directory Discovery.

title: ESCU - Remote Desktop Network Traffic - Rule
description: This search looks for network traffic on TCP/3389, the default port used
  by remote desktop. While remote desktop traffic is not uncommon on a network, it
  is usually associated with known hosts. This search will ignore common RDP sources
  and common RDP destinations so you can focus on the uncommon uses of remote desktop
  on your network.

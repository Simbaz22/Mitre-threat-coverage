title: ESCU - Office Product Spawning Rundll32 with no DLL - Rule
description: The following detection identifies the latest behavior utilized by IcedID
  malware family. This detection identifies any Windows Office Product spawning `rundll32.exe`
  without a `.dll` file extension. In malicious instances, the command-line of `rundll32.exe`
  will look like `rundll32 ..\oepddl.igk2,DllRegisterServer`. In addition, Threat
  Research has released a detection identifying the use of `DllRegisterServer` on
  the command-line of `rundll32.exe`. In this instance, we narrow our detection down
  to the Office suite as a parent process. During triage, review all file modifications.
  Capture and analyze the `DLL` that was dropped to disk. The Office Product will
  have reached out to a remote destination, capture and block the IPs or domain. Review
  additional parallel processes for further activity.

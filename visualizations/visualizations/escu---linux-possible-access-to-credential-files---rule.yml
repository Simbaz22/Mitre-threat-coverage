title: ESCU - Linux Possible Access To Credential Files - Rule
description: This analytic is to detect a possible attempt to dump or access the content
  of /etc/passwd and /etc/shadow to enable offline credential cracking. "etc/passwd"
  store user information within linux OS while "etc/shadow" contain the user passwords
  hash. Adversaries and threat actors may attempt to access this to gain persistence
  and/or privilege escalation. This anomaly detection can be a good indicator of possible
  credential dumping technique but it might catch some normal administrator automation
  scripts or during credential auditing. In this scenario filter is needed.

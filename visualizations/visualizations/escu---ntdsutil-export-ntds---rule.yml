title: ESCU - Ntdsutil Export NTDS - Rule
description: "Monitor for signs that Ntdsutil is being used to Extract Active Directory\
  \ database - NTDS.dit, typically used for offline password cracking. It may be used\
  \ in normal circumstances with no command line arguments or shorthand variations\
  \ of more common arguments. Ntdsutil.exe is typically seen run on a Windows Server.\
  \ Typical command used to dump ntds.dit \nntdsutil \"ac i ntds\" \"ifm\" \"create\
  \ full C:\\Temp\" q q \nThis technique uses \"Install from Media\" (IFM), which\
  \ will extract a copy of the Active Directory database. A successful export of the\
  \ Active Directory database will yield a file modification named ntds.dit to the\
  \ destination."

title: ESCU - Linux Doas Tool Execution - Rule
description: This analytic is to detect the doas tool execution in linux host platform.
  This utility tool allow standard users to perform tasks as root, the same way sudo
  does. This tool is developed as a minimalistic alternative to sudo application.
  This tool can be abused advesaries, attacker or malware to gain elevated privileges
  to the targeted or compromised host. On the other hand this can also be executed
  by administrator for a certain task that needs admin rights. In this case filter
  is needed.

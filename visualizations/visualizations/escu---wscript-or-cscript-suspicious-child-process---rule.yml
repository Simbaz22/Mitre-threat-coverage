title: ESCU - Wscript Or Cscript Suspicious Child Process - Rule
description: This analytic identifies a suspicious spawned process by WScript or CScript
  process. This technique was a common technique used by adversaries and malware to
  execute different LOLBIN, other scripts like PowerShell or spawn a suspended process
  to inject its code as a defense evasion. This TTP may detect some normal script
  that using several application tool that are in the list of the child process it
  detects but a good pivot and indicator that a script is may execute suspicious code.

title: ESCU - GetWmiObject Ds Group with PowerShell - Rule
description: This analytic looks for the execution of `powershell.exe` with command-line
  arguments utilized to query for domain groups. The `Get-WmiObject` commandlet combined
  with the `-class ds_group` parameter can be used to return the full list of groups
  in a Windows domain. Red Teams and adversaries alike may leverage WMI in this case,
  using PowerShell, to enumerate domain groups for situational awareness and Active
  Directory Discovery.

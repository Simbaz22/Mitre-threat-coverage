title: ESCU - Kerberoasting spn request with RC4 encryption - Rule
description: The following analytic leverages Kerberos Event 4769, A Kerberos service
  ticket was requested, to identify a potential kerberoasting attack against Active
  Directory networks. Kerberoasting allows an adversary to request kerberos tickets
  for domain accounts typically used as service accounts and attempt to crack them
  offline allowing them to obtain privileged access to the domain. This analytic looks
  for a specific combination of the Ticket_Options field based on common kerberoasting
  tools. Defenders should be aware that it may be possible for a Kerberoast attack
  to use different Ticket_Options.

title: ESCU - AWS IAM Delete Policy - Rule
description: The following detection identifes when a policy is deleted on AWS. This
  does not identify whether successful or failed, but the error messages tell a story
  of suspicious attempts. There is a specific process to follow when deleting a policy.
  First, detach the policy from all users, groups, and roles that the policy is attached
  to, using DetachUserPolicy , DetachGroupPolicy , or DetachRolePolicy.

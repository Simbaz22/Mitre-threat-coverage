title: ESCU - Suspicious Computer Account Name Change - Rule
description: As part of the sAMAccountName Spoofing (CVE-2021-42278) and Domain Controller
  Impersonation (CVE-2021-42287) exploitation chain, adversaries need to create a
  new computer account name and rename it to match the name of a domain controller
  account without the ending '$'. In Windows Active Directory environments, computer
  account names always end with `$`. This analytic leverages Event Id 4781, `The name
  of an account was changed`, to identify a computer account rename event with a suspicious
  name that does not terminate with `$`. This behavior could represent an exploitation
  attempt of CVE-2021-42278 and CVE-2021-42287 for privilege escalation.

title: ESCU - Schtasks Run Task On Demand - Rule
description: This analytic identifies an on demand run of a Windows Schedule Task
  through shell or command-line. This technique has been used by adversaries that
  force to run their created Schedule Task as their persistence mechanism or for lateral
  movement as part of their malicious attack to the compromised machine.

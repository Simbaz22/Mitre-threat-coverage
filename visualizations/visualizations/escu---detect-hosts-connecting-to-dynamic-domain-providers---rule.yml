title: ESCU - Detect hosts connecting to dynamic domain providers - Rule
description: Malicious actors often abuse legitimate Dynamic DNS services to host
  malicious payloads or interactive command and control nodes. Attackers will automate
  domain resolution changes by routing dynamic domains to countless IP addresses to
  circumvent firewall blocks, block lists as well as frustrate a network defenders
  analytic and investigative processes. This search will look for DNS queries made
  from within your infrastructure to suspicious dynamic domains.

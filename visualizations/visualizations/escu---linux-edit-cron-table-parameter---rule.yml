title: ESCU - Linux Edit Cron Table Parameter - Rule
description: The following analytic identifies a suspicious cronjobs modification
  using crontab edit parameter. This commandline parameter can be abuse by malware
  author, adversaries, and red red teamers to add cronjob entry to their malicious
  code to execute to the schedule they want. This event can also be executed by administrator
  or normal user for automation purposes so filter is needed.

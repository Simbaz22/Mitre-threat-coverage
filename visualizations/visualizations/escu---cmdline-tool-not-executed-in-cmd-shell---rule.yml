title: ESCU - Cmdline Tool Not Executed In CMD Shell - Rule
description: The following analytic identifies a non-standard parent process (not
  matching CMD, PowerShell, or Explorer) spawning `ipconfig.exe` or `systeminfo.exe`.
  This particular behavior was seen in FIN7's JSSLoader .NET payload. This is also
  typically seen when an adversary is injected into another process performing different
  discovery techniques. This event stands out as a TTP since these tools are commonly
  executed with a shell application or Explorer parent, and not by another application.
  This TTP is a good indicator for an adversary gathering host information, but one
  possible false positive might be an automated tool used by a system administator.

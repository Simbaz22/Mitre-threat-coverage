title: ESCU - Local Account Discovery With Wmic - Rule
description: This analytic looks for the execution of `wmic.exe` with command-line
  arguments utilized to query for local users. The argument `useraccount` is used
  to leverage WMI to return a list of all local users. Red Teams and adversaries alike
  use net.exe to enumerate users for situational awareness and Active Directory Discovery.

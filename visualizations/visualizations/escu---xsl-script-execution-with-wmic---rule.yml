title: ESCU - XSL Script Execution With WMIC - Rule
description: This search is to detect a suspicious wmic.exe process or renamed wmic
  process to execute malicious xsl file. This technique was seen in FIN7 to execute
  its malicous jscript using the .xsl as the loader with the help of wmic.exe process.
  This TTP is really a good indicator for you to hunt further for FIN7 or other attacker
  that known to used this technique.

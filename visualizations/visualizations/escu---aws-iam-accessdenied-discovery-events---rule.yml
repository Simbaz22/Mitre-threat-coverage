title: ESCU - AWS IAM AccessDenied Discovery Events - Rule
description: The following detection identifies excessive AccessDenied events within
  an hour timeframe. It is possible that an access key to AWS may have been stolen
  and is being misused to perform discovery events. In these instances, the access
  is not available with the key stolen therefore these events will be generated.

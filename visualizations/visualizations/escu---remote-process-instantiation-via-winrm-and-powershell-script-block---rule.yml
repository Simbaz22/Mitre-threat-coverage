title: ESCU - Remote Process Instantiation via WinRM and PowerShell Script Block -
  Rule
description: The following analytic utilizes PowerShell Script Block Logging (EventCode=4104)
  to identify the execution of PowerShell with arguments utilized to start a process
  on a remote endpoint by abusing the WinRM protocol. Specifically, this search looks
  for the abuse of the `Invoke-Command` commandlet. Red Teams and adversaries alike
  may abuse WinRM for lateral movement and remote code execution.

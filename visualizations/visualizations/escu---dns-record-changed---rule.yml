description: 'WARNING, this detection has been marked deprecated by the Splunk Threat
  Research team, this means that it will no longer be maintained or supported. If
  you have any questions feel free to email us at: research@splunk.com. The search
  takes the DNS records and their answers results of the discovered_dns_records lookup
  and finds if any records have changed by searching DNS response from the Network_Resolution
  datamodel across the last day.'

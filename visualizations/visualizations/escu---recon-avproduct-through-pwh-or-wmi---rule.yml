title: ESCU - Recon AVProduct Through Pwh or WMI - Rule
description: The following analytic identifies suspicious PowerShell script execution
  via EventCode 4104 performing checks to identify anti-virus products installed on
  the endpoint. This technique is commonly found in malware and APT events where the
  adversary will map all running security applications or services. During triage,
  review parallel processes within the same timeframe. Review the full script block
  to identify other related artifacts.

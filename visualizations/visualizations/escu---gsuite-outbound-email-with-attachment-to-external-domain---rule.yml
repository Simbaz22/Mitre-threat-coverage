title: ESCU - Gsuite Outbound Email With Attachment To External Domain - Rule
description: This search is to detect a suspicious outbound e-mail from internal email
  to external email domain. This can be a good hunting query to monitor insider or
  outbound email traffic for not common domain e-mail. The idea is to parse the domain
  of destination email check if there is a minimum outbound traffic < 20 with attachment.

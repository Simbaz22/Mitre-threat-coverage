title: ESCU - Linux Add Files In Known Crontab Directories - Rule
description: The following analytic identifies a suspicious file creation in known
  cron table directories. This event is commonly abuse by malware, adversaries and
  red teamers to persist on the target or compromised host. crontab or cronjob is
  like a schedule task in windows environment where you can create an executable or
  script on the known crontab directories to run it base on its schedule. This Anomaly
  query is a good indicator to look further what file is added and who added the file
  if to consider it legitimate file.

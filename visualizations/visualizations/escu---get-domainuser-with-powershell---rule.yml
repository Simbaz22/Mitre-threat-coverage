description: This analytic looks for the execution of `powershell.exe` with command-line
  arguments utilized to enumerate domain users. `Get-DomainUser` is part of PowerView,
  a PowerShell tool used to perform enumeration on Windows domains. Red Teams and
  adversaries alike may leverage PowerView to enumerate domain users for situational
  awareness and Active Directory Discovery.

title: ESCU - Potentially malicious code on commandline - Rule
description: The following analytic uses a pretrained machine learning text classifier
  to detect potentially malicious commandlines.  The model identifies unusual combinations
  of keywords found in samples of commandlines where adversaries executed powershell
  code, primarily for C2 communication.  For example, adversaries will leverage IO
  capabilities such as "streamreader" and "webclient", threading capabilties such
  as "mutex" locks, programmatic constructs like "function" and "catch", and cryptographic
  operations like "computehash".  Although observing one of these keywords in a commandline
  script is possible, combinations of keywords observed in attack data are not typically
  found in normal usage of the commandline.  The model will output a score where all
  values above zero are suspicious, anything greater than one particularly so.

title: ESCU - SchCache Change By App Connect And Create ADSI Object - Rule
description: This analytic is to detect an application try to connect and create ADSI
  Object to do LDAP query. Every time an application connects to the directory and
  attempts to create an ADSI object, the Active Directory Schema is checked for changes.
  If it has changed since the last connection, the schema is downloaded and stored
  in a cache on the local computer either in %LOCALAPPDATA%\Microsoft\Windows\SchCache
  or %systemroot%\SchCache. We found this a good anomaly use case to detect suspicious
  application like blackmatter ransomware that use ADS object api to execute ldap
  query. having a good list of ldap or normal AD query tool used within the network
  is a good start to reduce the noise.

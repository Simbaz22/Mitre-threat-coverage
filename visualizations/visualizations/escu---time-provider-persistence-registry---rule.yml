title: ESCU - Time Provider Persistence Registry - Rule
description: This analytic is to detect a suspicious modification of time provider
  registry for persistence and autostart. This technique can allow the attacker to
  persist on the compromised host and autostart as soon as the machine boot up. This
  TTP can be a good indicator of suspicious behavior since this registry is not commonly
  modified by normal user or even an admin.

title: ESCU - Short Lived Scheduled Task - Rule
description: The following analytic leverages Windows Security EventCode 4698, `A
  scheduled task was created` and Windows Security EventCode 4699, `A scheduled task
  was deleted` to identify scheduled tasks created and deleted in less than 30 seconds.
  This behavior may represent a lateral movement attack abusing the Task Scheduler
  to obtain code execution. Red Teams and adversaries alike may abuse the Task Scheduler
  for lateral movement and remote code execution.

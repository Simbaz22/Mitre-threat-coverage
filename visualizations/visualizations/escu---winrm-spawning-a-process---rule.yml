title: ESCU - WinRM Spawning a Process - Rule
description: The following analytic identifies suspicious processes spawning from
  WinRM (wsmprovhost.exe). This analytic is related to potential exploitation of CVE-2021-31166.
  which is a kernel-mode device driver http.sys vulnerability. Current proof of concept
  code will blue-screen the operating system. However, http.sys used by many different
  Windows processes, including WinRM. In this case, identifying suspicious process
  create (child processes) from `wsmprovhost.exe` is what this analytic is identifying.

description: 'WARNING, this detection has been marked deprecated by the Splunk Threat
  Research team, this means that it will no longer be maintained or supported. If
  you have any questions feel free to email us at: research@splunk.com. This search
  looks for AWS provisioning activities from previously unseen regions. Region in
  this context is similar to a state in the United States. Provisioning activities
  are defined broadly as any event that begins with "Run" or "Create." This search
  is deprecated and have been translated to use the latest Change Datamodel.'

title: ESCU - Wermgr Process Create Executable File - Rule
description: this search is designed to detect potential malicious wermgr.exe process
  that drops or create executable file. Since wermgr.exe is an application trigger
  when error encountered in a process, it is really un ussual to this process to drop
  executable file. This technique is commonly seen in trickbot malware where it injects
  it code to this process to execute it malicious behavior like downloading other
  payload

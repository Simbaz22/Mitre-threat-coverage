title: ESCU - SecretDumps Offline NTDS Dumping Tool - Rule
description: This analytic detects a potential usage of secretsdump.py tool for dumping
  credentials (ntlm hash) from a copy of ntds.dit and SAM.Security,SYSTEM registrry
  hive. This technique was seen in some attacker that dump ntlm hashes offline after
  having a copy of ntds.dit and SAM/SYSTEM/SECURITY registry hive.

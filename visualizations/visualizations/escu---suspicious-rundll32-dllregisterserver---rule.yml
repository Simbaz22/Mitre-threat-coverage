title: ESCU - Suspicious Rundll32 dllregisterserver - Rule
description: The following analytic identifies rundll32.exe using dllregisterserver
  on the command line to load a DLL. When a DLL is registered, the DllRegisterServer
  method entry point in the DLL is invoked. This is typically seen when a DLL is being
  registered on the system. Not every instance is considered malicious, but it will
  capture malicious use of it. During investigation, review the parent process and
  parrellel processes executing. Capture the DLL being loaded and inspect further.
  Rundll32.exe is natively found in C:\Windows\system32 and C:\Windows\syswow64.

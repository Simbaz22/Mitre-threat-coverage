title: ESCU - Domain Controller Discovery with Nltest
description: This analytic looks for the execution of `nltest.exe` with command-line
  arguments utilized to discover remote systems. The arguments `/dclist:` and '/dsgetdc:',
  can be used to return a list of all domain controllers. Red Teams and adversaries
  alike may use nltest.exe to identify domain controllers in a Windows Domain for
  situational awareness and Active Directory Discovery.

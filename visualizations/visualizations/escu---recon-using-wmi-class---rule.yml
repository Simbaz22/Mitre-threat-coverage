title: ESCU - Recon Using WMI Class - Rule
description: The following analytic identifies suspicious PowerShell via EventCode
  4104, where WMI is performing an event query looking for running processes or running
  services. This technique is commonly found where the adversary will identify services
  and system information on the compromised machine. During triage, review parallel
  processes within the same timeframe. Review the full script block to identify other
  related artifacts.

title: ESCU - DSQuery Domain Discovery - Rule
description: "The following analytic identifies \"dsquery.exe\" execution with arguments\
  \ looking for `TrustedDomain` query directly on the command-line. This is typically\
  \ indicative of an Administrator or adversary perform domain trust discovery. Note\
  \ that this query does not identify any other variations of \"Dsquery.exe\" usage.\n\
  Within this detection, it is assumed `dsquery.exe` is not moved or renamed.\nThe\
  \ search will return the first time and last time these command-line arguments were\
  \ used for these executions, as well as the target system, the user, process \"\
  dsquery.exe\" and its parent process.\nDSQuery.exe is natively found in `C:\\Windows\\\
  system32` and `C:\\Windows\\syswow64` and only on Server operating system.\nThe\
  \ following DLL(s) are loaded when DSQuery.exe is launched `dsquery.dll`. If found\
  \ loaded by another process, it is possible dsquery is running within that process\
  \ context in memory.\nIn addition to trust discovery, review parallel processes\
  \ for additional behaviors performed. Identify the parent process and capture any\
  \ files (batch files, for example) being used."

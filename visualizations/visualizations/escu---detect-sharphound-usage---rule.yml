title: ESCU - Detect SharpHound Usage - Rule
description: The following analytic identifies SharpHound binary usage by using the
  original filena,e. In addition to renaming the PE, other coverage is available to
  detect command-line arguments. This particular analytic looks for the original_file_name
  of `SharpHound.exe` and the process name. It is possible older instances of SharpHound.exe
  have different original filenames. Dependent upon the operator, the code may be
  re-compiled and the attributes removed or changed to anything else. During triage,
  review the metadata of the binary in question. Review parallel processes for suspicious
  behavior. Identify the source of this binary.

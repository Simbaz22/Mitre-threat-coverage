title: ESCU - Linux File Creation In Init Boot Directory - Rule
description: This analytic looks for suspicious file creation on init system directories
  for automatic execution of script or file upon boot up. This technique is commonly
  abuse by adversaries, malware author and red teamer to persist on the targeted or
  compromised host. This behavior can be executed or use by an administrator or network
  operator to add script files or binary files as part of a task or automation. filter

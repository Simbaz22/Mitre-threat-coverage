title: ESCU - Randomly Generated Scheduled Task Name - Rule
description: The following hunting analytic leverages Event ID 4698, `A scheduled
  task was created`, to identify the creation of a Scheduled Task with a suspicious,
  high entropy, Task Name. To achieve this, this analytic also leverages the `ut_shannon`
  function from the URL ToolBox Splunk application. Red teams and adversaries alike
  may abuse the Task Scheduler to create and start a remote Scheduled Task and obtain
  remote code execution. To achieve this goal, tools like Impacket or Crapmapexec,
  typically create a Scheduled Task with a random task name on the victim host. This
  hunting analytic may help defenders identify Scheduled Tasks created as part of
  a lateral movement attack. The entropy threshold `ut_shannon > 3` should be customized
  by users. The Command field can be used to determine if the task has malicious intent
  or not.

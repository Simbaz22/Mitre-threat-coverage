title: ESCU - Suspicious Linux Discovery Commands - Rule
description: "This search, detects execution of suspicious bash commands from various\
  \ commonly leveraged bash scripts like (AutoSUID, LinEnum, LinPeas) to perform discovery\
  \ of possible paths of privilege execution, password files, vulnerable directories,\
  \ executables and file permissions on a Linux host.\nThe search logic specifically\
  \ looks for high number of distinct commands run in a short period of time."

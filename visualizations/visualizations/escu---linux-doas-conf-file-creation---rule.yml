title: ESCU - Linux Doas Conf File Creation - Rule
description: This analytic is to detect the creation of doas.conf file in linux host
  platform. This configuration file can be use by doas utility tool to allow or permit
  standard users to perform tasks as root, the same way sudo does. This tool is developed
  as a minimalistic alternative to sudo application. This tool can be abused advesaries,
  attacker or malware to gain elevated privileges to the targeted or compromised host.
  On the other hand this can also be executed by administrator for a certain task
  that needs admin rights. In this case filter is needed.

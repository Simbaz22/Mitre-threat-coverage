title: ESCU - Detect Spike in AWS API Activity - Rule
description: 'WARNING, this detection has been marked deprecated by the Splunk Threat
  Research team, this means that it will no longer be maintained or supported. If
  you have any questions feel free to email us at: research@splunk.com. This search
  will detect users creating spikes of API activity in your AWS environment.  It will

title: ESCU - Detect AWS Console Login by New User - Rule
description: This search looks for AWS CloudTrail events wherein a console login event
  by a user was recorded within the last hour, then compares the event to a lookup
  file of previously seen users (by ARN values) who have logged into the console.
  The alert is fired if the user has logged into the console for the first time within
  the last hour

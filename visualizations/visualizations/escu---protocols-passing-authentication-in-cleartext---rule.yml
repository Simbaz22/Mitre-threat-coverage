title: ESCU - Protocols passing authentication in cleartext - Rule
description: The following analytic identifies cleartext protocols at risk of leaking
  sensitive information. Currently, this consists of legacy protocols such as telnet
  (port 23), POP3 (port 110), IMAP (port 143), and non-anonymous FTP (port 21) sessions.
  While some of these protocols may be used over SSL, they typically are found on
  different assigned ports in those instances.

title: ESCU - Possible Browser Pass View Parameter - Rule
description: This analytic will detect if a suspicious process contains a commandline
  parameter related to a web browser credential dumper. This technique is used by
  Remcos RAT malware which uses the Nirsoft webbrowserpassview.exe application to
  dump web browser credentials. Remcos uses the "/stext" command line to dump the
  credentials in text format. This Hunting query is a good indicator of hosts suffering
  from possible Remcos RAT infection. Since the hunting query is based on the parameter
  command and the possible path where it will save the text credential information,
  it may catch normal tools that are using the same command and behavior.

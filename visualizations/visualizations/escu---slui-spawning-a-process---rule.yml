title: ESCU - SLUI Spawning a Process - Rule
description: The following analytic identifies the Microsoft Software Licensing User
  Interface Tool, `slui.exe`, spawning a child process. This behavior is associated
  with publicly known UAC bypass. `slui.exe` is commonly associated with software
  updates and is most often spawned by `svchost.exe`. The `slui.exe` process should
  not have child processes, and any processes spawning from it will be running with
  elevated privileges. During triage, review the child process and additional parallel
  processes. Identify any file modifications that may have lead to the bypass.

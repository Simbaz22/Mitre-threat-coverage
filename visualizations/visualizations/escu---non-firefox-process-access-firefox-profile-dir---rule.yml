title: ESCU - Non Firefox Process Access Firefox Profile Dir - Rule
description: This search is to detect an anomaly event of non-firefox process accessing
  the files in  profile folder. This folder contains all the sqlite database of the
  firefox browser related to users login, history, cookies and etc. Most of the RAT,
  trojan spy as well as FIN7 jssloader try to parse the those sqlite database to collect
  information on the compromised host. This SACL Event (4663) need to be enabled to
  tthe firefox profile directory to be eable to use this. Since you monitoring this
  access to the folder a noise coming from firefox need to be filter and also sqlite
  db browser and explorer .exe to make this detection more stable.

title: ESCU - Impacket Lateral Movement Commandline Parameters - Rule
description: This analytic looks for the presence of suspicious commandline parameters
  typically present when using Impacket tools. Impacket is a collection of python
  classes meant to be used with Microsoft network protocols. There are multiple scripts
  that leverage impacket libraries like `wmiexec.py`, `smbexec.py`, `dcomexec.py`
  and `atexec.py` used to execute commands on remote endpoints. By default, these
  scripts leverage administrative shares and hardcoded parameters that can be used
  as a signature to detect its use. Red Teams and adversaries alike may leverage Impackets
  tools for lateral movement and remote code execution.

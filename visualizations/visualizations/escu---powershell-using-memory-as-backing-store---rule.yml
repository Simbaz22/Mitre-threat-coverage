title: ESCU - Powershell Using memory As Backing Store - Rule
description: The following analytic identifies suspicious PowerShell script execution
  via EventCode 4104 that is using memory stream as new object backstore. The malicious
  PowerShell script will contain stream flate data and will be decompressed in memory
  to run or drop the actual payload. During triage, review parallel processes within
  the same timeframe. Review the full script block to identify other related artifacts.

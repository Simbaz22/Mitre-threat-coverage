title: ESCU - Detect AWS API Activities From Unapproved Accounts - Rule
description: 'WARNING, this detection has been marked deprecated by the Splunk Threat
  Research team, this means that it will no longer be maintained or supported. If
  you have any questions feel free to email us at: research@splunk.com. This search
  looks for successful AWS CloudTrail activity by user accounts that are not listed
  in the identity table or `aws_service_accounts.csv`. It returns event names and
  count, as well as the first and last time a specific user or service is detected,
  grouped by users. Deprecated because managing this list can be quite hard.'

title: ESCU - Linux Deleting Critical Directory Using RM Command - Rule
description: The following analytic identifies a suspicious deletion of a critical
  folder in Linux machine using rm command. This technique was seen in industroyer2
  campaign to wipe or destroy energy facilities of a targeted sector. Deletion in
  these list of folder is not so common since it need some elevated privileges to
  access some of it. We recommend to look further events specially in file access
  or file deletion, process commandline that may related to this technique.

title: ESCU - Ping Sleep Batch Command - Rule
description: This analytic will identify the possible execution of ping sleep batch
  commands. This technique was seen in several malware samples and is used to trigger
  sleep times without explicitly calling sleep functions or commandlets. The goal
  is to delay the execution of malicious code and bypass detection or sandbox analysis.
  This  detection can be a good indicator of a process delaying its execution for
  malicious purposes.

title: ESCU - Windows Event Log Cleared
description: The following analytic utilizes Windows Security Event ID 1102 or System
  log event 104 to identify when a Windows event log is cleared. Note that this analytic
  will require tuning or restricted to specific endpoints based on criticality. During
  triage, based on time of day and user, determine if this was planned. If not planned,
  follow through with reviewing parallel alerts and other data sources to determine
  what else may have occurred.

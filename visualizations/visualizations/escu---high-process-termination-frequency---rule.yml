title: ESCU - High Process Termination Frequency - Rule
description: This analytics are designed to indentify a high frequency of process
  termination on a machine which is a common behavior of ransomware malware before
  encrypting files. This technique is designed to avoid an exception error while accessing
  (docs, images, database and etc..) in the infected machine for encryption.

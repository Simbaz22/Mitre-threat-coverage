title: ESCU - Spoolsv Suspicious Process Access - Rule
description: This analytic identifies a suspicious behavior related to PrintNightmare,
  or CVE-2021-34527 previously (CVE-2021-1675),  to gain privilege escalation on the
  vulnerable machine. This exploit attacks a critical Windows Print Spooler Vulnerability
  to elevate privilege. This detection is to look for suspicious process access made
  by the spoolsv.exe that may related to the attack.

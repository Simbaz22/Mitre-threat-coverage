title: ESCU - GetDomainGroup with PowerShell Script Block - Rule
description: The following analytic utilizes PowerShell Script Block Logging (EventCode=4104)
  to identify the execution of the `Get-DomainGroup` commandlet. `Get-DomainGroup`
  is part of PowerView, a PowerShell tool used to perform enumeration on Windows domains.
  As the name suggests, `Get-DomainGroup` is used to query domain groups. Red Teams
  and adversaries may leverage this function to enumerate domain groups for situational
  awareness and Active Directory Discovery.

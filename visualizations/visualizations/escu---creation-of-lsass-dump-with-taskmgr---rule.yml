title: ESCU - Creation of lsass Dump with Taskmgr - Rule
description: Detect the hands on keyboard behavior of Windows Task Manager creating
  a process dump of lsass.exe. Upon this behavior occurring, a file write/modification
  will occur in the users profile under \AppData\Local\Temp. The dump file, lsass.dmp,
  cannot be renamed, however if the dump occurs more than once, it will be named lsass
  (2).dmp.

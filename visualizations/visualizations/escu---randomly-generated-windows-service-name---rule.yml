title: ESCU - Randomly Generated Windows Service Name - Rule
description: The following hunting analytic leverages Event ID 7045, `A new service
  was installed in the system`, to identify the installation of a Windows Service
  with a suspicious, high entropy, Service Name. To achieve this, this analytic also
  leverages the `ut_shannon` function from the URL ToolBox Splunk application. Red
  teams and adversaries alike may abuse the Service Control Manager to create and
  start a remote Windows Service and obtain remote code execution. To achieve this
  goal, some tools like Metasploit, Cobalt Strike and Impacket, typically create a
  Windows Service with a random service name on the victim host. This hunting analytic
  may help defenders identify Windows Services installed as part of a lateral movement
  attack. The entropy threshold `ut_shannon > 3` should be customized by users. The
  Service_File_Name field can be used to determine if the Windows Service has malicious
  intent or not.

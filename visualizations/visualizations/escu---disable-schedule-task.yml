title: ESCU - Disable Schedule Task
description: This analytic is to detect a suspicious commandline to disable existing
  schedule task. This technique is used by adversaries or commodity malware like IceID
  to disable security application (AV products) in the targetted host to evade detections.
  This TTP is a good pivot to check further why and what other process run before
  and after this detection. check which process execute the commandline and what task
  is disabled. parent child process is quite valuable in this scenario too.

title: ESCU - Cloud Network Access Control List Deleted - Rule
description: "WARNING, this detection has been marked deprecated by the Splunk Threat\
  \ Research team, this means that it will no longer be maintained or supported. If\
  \ you have any questions feel free to email us at: research@splunk.com. Enforcing\
  \ network-access controls is one of the defensive mechanisms used by cloud administrators\
  \ to restrict access to a cloud instance. After the attacker has gained control\
  \ of the console by compromising an admin account, they can delete a network ACL\
  \ and gain access to the instance from anywhere. This search will query the Change\
  \ datamodel to detect users deleting network ACLs. Deprecated because it's a duplicate"

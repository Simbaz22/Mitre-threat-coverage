title: ESCU - No Windows Updates in a time frame - Rule
description: This search looks for Windows endpoints that have not generated an event
  indicating a successful Windows update in the last 60 days. Windows updates are
  typically released monthly and applied shortly thereafter. An endpoint that has
  not successfully applied an update in this time frame indicates the endpoint is
  not regularly being patched for some reason.

title: ESCU - Disable Defender AntiVirus Registry - Rule
description: This particular behavior is typically executed when an adversaries or
  malware gains access to an endpoint and beings to perform execution and to evade
  detections. Usually, a batch (.bat) will be executed and multiple registry and scheduled
  task modifications will occur. During triage, review parallel processes and identify
  any further file modifications. Endpoint should be isolated.

title: ESCU - Prohibited Network Traffic Allowed - Rule
description: This search looks for network traffic defined by port and transport layer
  protocol in the Enterprise Security lookup table "lookup_interesting_ports", that
  is marked as prohibited, and has an associated 'allow' action in the Network_Traffic
  data model. This could be indicative of a misconfigured network device.

title: ESCU - Regsvr32 Silent and Install Param Dll Loading - Rule
description: This analytic is to detect a loading of dll using regsvr32 application
  with silent parameter and dllinstall execution. This technique was seen in several
  RAT malware similar to remcos, njrat and adversaries to load their malicious DLL
  on the compromised machine. This TTP may executed by normal 3rd party application
  so it is better to pivot by the parent process, parent command-line and command-line
  of the file that execute this regsvr32.

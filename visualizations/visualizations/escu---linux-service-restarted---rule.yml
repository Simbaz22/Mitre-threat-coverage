title: ESCU - Linux Service Restarted - Rule
description: This analytic looks for restarted or re-enable services in linux platform.
  This technique can be executed or performed using systemctl or service tool application.
  Adversaries may create or modify Windows services to repeatedly execute malicious
  payloads as part of persistence. When Windows boots up, it starts programs or applications
  called services that perform background system functions. Administrator may also
  create a legitimated service for a specific tool or normal application as part of
  task or automation, in this scenario it is suggested to look for the service path
  of the actual script or executable that register as service and who created the
  service for further verification.

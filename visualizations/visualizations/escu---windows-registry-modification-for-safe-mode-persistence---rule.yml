title: ESCU - Windows Registry Modification for Safe Mode Persistence - Rule
description: The following analytic identifies a modification or registry add to the
  safeboot registry as an autostart mechanism. This technique is utilized by adversaries
  to persist a driver or service into Safe Mode. Two keys are monitored in this analytic,  Minimal
  and Network. adding values to Minimal will load into Safe Mode and by adding into
  Network it will provide the service or drive the ability to perform network connections
  in Safe Mode.

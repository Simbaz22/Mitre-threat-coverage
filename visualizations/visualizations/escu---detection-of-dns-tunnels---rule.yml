title: ESCU - Detection of DNS Tunnels - Rule
description: "WARNING, this detection has been marked deprecated by the Splunk Threat\
  \ Research team, this means that it will no longer be maintained or supported. If\
  \ you have any questions feel free to email us at: research@splunk.com. This search\
  \ is used to detect DNS tunneling, by calculating the sum of the length of DNS queries\
  \ and DNS answers. The search also filters out potential false positives by filtering\
  \ out queries made to internal systems and the queries originating from internal\
  \ DNS, Web, and Email servers. Endpoints using DNS as a method of transmission for\
  \ data exfiltration, command and control, or evasion of security controls can often\
  \ be detected by noting an unusually large volume of DNS traffic. \nNOTE:Deprecated\
  \ because existing detection is doing the same. This detection is replaced with\
  \ two other variations, if you are using MLTK then you can use this search `ESCU\
  \ - DNS Query Length Outliers - MLTK - Rule` or use the standard deviation version\
  \ `ESCU - DNS Query Length With High Standard Deviation - Rule`, as an alternantive."

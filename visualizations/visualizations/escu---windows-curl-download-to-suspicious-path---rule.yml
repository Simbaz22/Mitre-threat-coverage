description: "The following analytic identifies the use of Windows Curl.exe downloading\
  \ a file to a suspicious location. \n-O or --output is used when a file is to be\
  \ downloaded and placed in a specified location. \nDuring triage, review parallel\
  \ processes for further behavior. In addition, identify if the download was successful.\
  \ If a file was downloaded, capture and analyze."

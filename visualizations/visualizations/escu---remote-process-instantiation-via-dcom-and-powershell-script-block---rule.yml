title: ESCU - Remote Process Instantiation via DCOM and PowerShell Script Block -
  Rule
description: The following analytic utilizes PowerShell Script Block Logging (EventCode=4104)
  to identify the execution of PowerShell with arguments utilized to start a process
  on a remote endpoint by abusing the DCOM protocol. Specifically, this search looks
  for the abuse of ShellExecute and ExecuteShellCommand. Red Teams and adversaries
  alike may abuse DCOM for lateral movement and remote code execution.

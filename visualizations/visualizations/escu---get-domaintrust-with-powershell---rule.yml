title: ESCU - Get-DomainTrust with PowerShell - Rule
description: This analytic identifies Get-DomainTrust from PowerView in order to gather
  domain trust information. Typically, this is utilized within a script being executed
  and used to enumerate the domain trust information. This grants the adversary an
  understanding of how large or small the domain is. During triage, review parallel
  processes using an EDR product or 4688 events. It will be important to understand
  the timeline of events around this activity.

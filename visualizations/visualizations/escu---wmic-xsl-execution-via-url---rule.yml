title: ESCU - WMIC XSL Execution via URL - Rule
description: The following analytic identifies `wmic.exe` loading a remote XSL (eXtensible
  Stylesheet Language) script. This originally was identified by Casey Smith, dubbed
  Squiblytwo, as an application control bypass. Many adversaries will utilize this
  technique to invoke JScript or VBScript within an XSL file. This technique can also
  execute local/remote scripts and, similar to its Regsvr32 "Squiblydoo" counterpart,
  leverages a trusted, built-in Windows tool. Adversaries may abuse any alias in Windows
  Management Instrumentation provided they utilize the /FORMAT switch. Upon identifying
  a suspicious execution, review for confirmed network connnection and script download.

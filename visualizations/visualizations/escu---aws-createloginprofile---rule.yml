title: ESCU - AWS CreateLoginProfile - Rule
description: This search looks for AWS CloudTrail events where a user A(victim A)
  creates a login profile for user B, followed by a AWS Console login event from user
  B from the same src_ip as user B. This correlated event can be indicative of privilege
  escalation since both events happened from the same src_ip

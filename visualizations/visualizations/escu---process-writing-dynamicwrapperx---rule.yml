title: ESCU - Process Writing DynamicWrapperX - Rule
description: DynamicWrapperX is an ActiveX component that can be used in a script
  to call Windows API functions, but it requires the dynwrapx.dll to be installed
  and registered. With that, a binary writing dynwrapx.dll to disk and registering
  it into the registry is highly suspect. Why is it needed? In most malicious instances,
  it will be written to disk at a non-standard location. During triage, review parallel
  processes and pivot on the process_guid. Review the registry for any suspicious
  modifications meant to load dynwrapx.dll. Identify any suspicious module loads of
  dynwrapx.dll. This will identify the process that will invoke vbs/wscript/cscript.

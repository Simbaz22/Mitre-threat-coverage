title: ESCU - Suspicious Driver Loaded Path - Rule
description: This analytic will detect suspicious driver loaded paths. This technique
  is commonly used by malicious software like coin miners (xmrig) to register its
  malicious driver from notable directories where executable or drivers do not commonly
  exist. During triage, validate this driver is for legitimate business use. Review
  the metadata and certificate information. Unsigned drivers from non-standard paths
  is not normal, but occurs. In addition, review driver loads into `ntoskrnl.exe`
  for possible other drivers of interest. Long tail analyze drivers by path (outside
  of default, and in default) for further review.

title: ESCU - Suspicious SearchProtocolHost no Command Line Arguments - Rule
description: The following analytic identifies searchprotocolhost.exe with no command
  line arguments. It is unusual for searchprotocolhost.exe to execute with no command
  line arguments present. This particular behavior is common with malicious software,
  including Cobalt Strike. During investigation, identify any network connections
  and parallel processes. Identify any suspicious module loads related to credential
  dumping or file writes. searchprotocolhost.exe is natively found in C:\Windows\system32
  and C:\Windows\syswow64.

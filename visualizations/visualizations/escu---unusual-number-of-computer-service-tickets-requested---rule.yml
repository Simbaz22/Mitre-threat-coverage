title: ESCU - Unusual Number of Computer Service Tickets Requested - Rule
description: The following hunting analytic leverages Event ID 4769, `A Kerberos service
  ticket was requested`, to identify an unusual number of computer service ticket
  requests from one source. When a domain joined endpoint connects to a remote endpoint,
  it first will request a Kerberos Ticket with the computer name as the Service Name.
  An endpoint requesting a large number of computer service tickets for different
  endpoints could represent malicious behavior like lateral movement, malware staging,
  reconnaissance, etc.

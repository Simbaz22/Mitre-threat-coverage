title: ESCU - Detect Long DNS TXT Record Response - Rule
description: 'WARNING, this detection has been marked deprecated by the Splunk Threat
  Research team, this means that it will no longer be maintained or supported. If
  you have any questions feel free to email us at: research@splunk.com. This search
  is used to detect attempts to use DNS tunneling, by calculating the length of responses
  to DNS TXT queries. Endpoints using DNS as a method of transmission for data exfiltration,
  command and control, or evasion of security controls can often be detected by noting
  unusually large volumes of DNS traffic. Deprecated because this detection should
  focus on DNS queries instead of DNS responses.'

title: ESCU - Processes created by netsh - Rule
description: 'WARNING, this detection has been marked deprecated by the Splunk Threat
  Research team, this means that it will no longer be maintained or supported. If
  you have any questions feel free to email us at: research@splunk.com. This search
  looks for processes launching netsh.exe to execute various commands via the netsh
  command-line utility. Netsh.exe is a command-line scripting utility that allows
  you to, either locally or remotely, display or modify the network configuration
  of a computer that is currently running. Netsh can be used as a persistence proxy
  technique to execute a helper .dll when netsh.exe is executed. In this search, we
  are looking for processes spawned by netsh.exe that are executing commands via the
  command line. Deprecated because we have another detection of the same type.'

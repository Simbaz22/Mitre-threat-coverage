title: ESCU - Linux NOPASSWD Entry In Sudoers File - Rule
description: This analytic is to look for suspicious command lines that may add entry
  to /etc/sudoers with NOPASSWD attribute in linux platform. This technique is commonly
  abuse by adversaries, malware author and red teamers to gain elevated privilege
  to the targeted or compromised host. /etc/sudoers file controls who can run what
  commands users can execute on the machines and can also control whether user need
  a password to execute particular commands. This file is composed of aliases (basically
  variables) and user specifications.

title: ESCU - AWS Network Access Control List Deleted - Rule
description: Enforcing network-access controls is one of the defensive mechanisms
  used by cloud administrators to restrict access to a cloud instance. After the attacker
  has gained control of the AWS console by compromising an admin account, they can
  delete a network ACL and gain access to the instance from anywhere. This search
  will query the AWS CloudTrail logs to detect users deleting network ACLs.

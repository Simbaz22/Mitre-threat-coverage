title: ESCU - Linux Change File Owner To Root - Rule
description: This analytic looks for a commandline that change the file owner to root
  using chown utility tool. This technique is commonly abuse by adversaries, malware
  author and red teamers to escalate privilege to the targeted or compromised host
  by changing the owner of their malicious file to root. This event is not so common
  in corporate network except from the administrator doing normal task that needs
  high privilege.

title: ESCU - Icacls Deny Command - Rule
description: This analytic identifies a potential adversary that changes the security
  permission of a specific file or directory. This technique is commonly seen in APT
  tradecraft or coinminer scripts. This behavior is meant to evade detection and prevent
  access to their component files.

title: ESCU - Linux File Creation In Profile Directory - Rule
description: This analytic looks for suspicious file creation in /etc/profile.d directory
  to automatically execute scripts by shell upon boot up of a linux machine. This
  technique is commonly abused by adversaries, malware and red teamers as a persistence
  mechanism to the targeted or compromised host. This Anomaly detection is a good
  indicator that someone wants to run a code after boot up which can be done also
  by the administrator or network operator for automation purposes.

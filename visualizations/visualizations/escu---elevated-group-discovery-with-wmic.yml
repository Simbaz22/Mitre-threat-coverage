title: ESCU - Elevated Group Discovery With Wmic
description: This analytic looks for the execution of `wmic.exe` with command-line
  arguments utilized to query for specific domain groups. Red Teams and adversaries
  alike use net.exe to enumerate elevated domain groups for situational awareness
  and Active Directory Discovery to identify high privileged users.

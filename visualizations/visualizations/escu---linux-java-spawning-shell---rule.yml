title: ESCU - Linux Java Spawning Shell - Rule
description: The following analytic identifies the process name of Java, Apache, or
  Tomcat spawning a Linux shell. This is potentially indicative of exploitation of
  the Java application and may be related to current event CVE-2021-44228 (Log4Shell).
  The shells included in the macro are "sh", "ksh", "zsh", "bash", "dash", "rbash",
  "fish", "csh', "tcsh', "ion", "eshell". Upon triage, review parallel processes and
  command-line arguments to determine legitimacy.

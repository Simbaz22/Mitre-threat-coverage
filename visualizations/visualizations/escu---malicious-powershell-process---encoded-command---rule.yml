title: ESCU - Malicious PowerShell Process - Encoded Command - Rule
description: '"The following analytic identifies the use of the EncodedCommand PowerShell
  parameter. This is typically used by Administrators to run complex scripts, but
  commonly used by adversaries to hide their code. The analytic identifies all variations
  of EncodedCommand, as PowerShell allows the ability to shorten the parameter. For
  example enc, enco, encod and so forth. In addition, through our research it was
  identified that PowerShell will interpret different command switch types beyond
  the hyphen. We have added endash, emdash, horizontal bar, and forward slash. During
  triage, review parallel events to determine legitimacy. Tune as needed based on
  admin scripts in use. Alternatively, may use regex per matching here https://regexr.com/662ov."'

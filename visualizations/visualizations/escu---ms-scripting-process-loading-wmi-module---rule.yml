title: ESCU - MS Scripting Process Loading WMI Module - Rule
description: This search is to detect a suspicious MS scripting process such as wscript.exe
  or cscript.exe that loading wmi module to process wmi query. This behavior was seen
  in FIN7 implant where it uses javascript to execute wmi query to parse host information
  that will send to its C2 server. this anomaly detections is a good initial step
  to hunt further a suspicious wmi query or wmi related events to the host that may
  give you good information regarding process that are commonly using wmi query or
  modules or might be an attacker using this technique.

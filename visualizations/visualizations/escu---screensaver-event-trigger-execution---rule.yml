title: ESCU - Screensaver Event Trigger Execution - Rule
description: This analytic is developed to detect possible event trigger execution
  through screensaver registry entry modification for persistence or privilege escalation.
  This technique was seen in several APT and malware where they put the malicious
  payload path to the SCRNSAVE.EXE registry key to redirect the execution to their
  malicious payload path. This TTP is a good indicator that some attacker may modify
  this entry for their persistence and privilege escalation.

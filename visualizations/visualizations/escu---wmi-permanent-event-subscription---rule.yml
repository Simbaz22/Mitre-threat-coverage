title: ESCU - WMI Permanent Event Subscription - Rule
description: "This analytic looks for the creation of WMI permanent event subscriptions.\
  \ The following analytic identifies the use of WMI Event Subscription to establish\
  \ persistence or perform privilege escalation. WMI can be used to install event\
  \ filters, providers, consumers, and bindings that execute code when a defined event\
  \ occurs. WMI subscription execution is proxied by the WMI Provider Host process\
  \ (WmiPrvSe.exe) and thus may result in elevated SYSTEM privileges. This analytic\
  \ is restricted by commonly added process execution and a path. If the volume is\
  \ low enough, remove the values and flag on any new subscriptions.\nAll event subscriptions\
  \ have three components \\\n\n    Filter - WQL Query for the events we want. EventID\
  \ = 19 \\\n    Consumer - An action to take upon triggering the filter. EventID\
  \ = 20 \\\n    Binding - Registers a filter to a consumer. EventID = 21\n    Monitor\
  \ for the creation of new WMI EventFilter, EventConsumer, and FilterToConsumerBinding.\
  \ It may be pertinent to review all 3 to identify the flow of execution. In addition,\
  \ EventCode 4104 may assist with any other PowerShell script usage that registered\
  \ the subscription."

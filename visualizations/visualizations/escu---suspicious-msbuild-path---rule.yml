title: ESCU - Suspicious msbuild path - Rule
description: The following analytic identifies msbuild.exe executing from a non-standard
  path. Msbuild.exe is natively found in C:\Windows\Microsoft.NET\Framework\v4.0.30319
  and C:\Windows\Microsoft.NET\Framework64\v4.0.30319. Instances of Visual Studio
  will run a copy of msbuild.exe. A moved instance of MSBuild is suspicious, however
  there are instances of build applications that will move or use a copy of MSBuild.

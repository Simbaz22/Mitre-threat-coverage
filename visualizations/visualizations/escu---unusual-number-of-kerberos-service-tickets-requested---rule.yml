title: ESCU - Unusual Number of Kerberos Service Tickets Requested - Rule
description: "The following hunting analytic leverages Kerberos Event 4769, A Kerberos\
  \ service ticket was requested, to identify a potential kerberoasting attack against\
  \ Active Directory networks. Kerberoasting allows an adversary to request kerberos\
  \ tickets for domain accounts typically used as service accounts and attempt to\
  \ crack them offline allowing them to obtain privileged access to the domain.\n\
  The detection calculates the standard deviation for each host and leverages the\
  \ 3-sigma statistical rule to identify an unusual number service ticket requests.\
  \ To customize this analytic, users can try different combinations of the `bucket`\
  \ span time and the calculation of the `upperBound` field."

title: ESCU - Suspicious mshta spawn - Rule
description: The following analytic identifies wmiprvse.exe spawning mshta.exe. This
  behavior is indicative of a DCOM object being utilized to spawn mshta from wmiprvse.exe
  or svchost.exe. In this instance, adversaries may use LethalHTA that will spawn
  mshta.exe from svchost.exe.

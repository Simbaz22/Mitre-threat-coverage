title: ESCU - Windows PowerShell Get-CIMInstance Remote Computer
description: This analytic identifies the use of Get-CimInstance cmdlet with the -ComputerName
  parameter, which indicates that the cmdlet is being used to retrieve information
  from a remote computer. This can be useful for detecting instances of remote access,
  such as when an attacker uses PowerShell to connect to a remote system and gather
  information. By monitoring for this cmdlet with the -ComputerName parameter, security
  analysts can identify potential malicious activity on remote systems and take appropriate
  action to mitigate any threats.

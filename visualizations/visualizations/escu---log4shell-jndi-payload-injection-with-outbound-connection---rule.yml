title: ESCU - Log4Shell JNDI Payload Injection with Outbound Connection - Rule
description: CVE-2021-44228 Log4Shell payloads can be injected via various methods,
  but on of the most common vectors injection is via Web calls. Many of the vulnerable
  java web applications that are using log4j have a web component to them are specially
  targets of this injection, specifically projects like Apache Struts, Flink, Druid,
  and Solr. The exploit is triggered by a LDAP lookup function in the log4j package,
  its invocation is similar to `${jndi:ldap://PAYLOAD_INJECTED}`, when executed against
  vulnerable web applications the invocation can be seen in various part of web logs.
  Specifically it has been successfully exploited via headers like X-Forwarded-For,
  User-Agent, Referer, and X-Api-Version. In this detection we match the invocation
  function with a network connection to a malicious ip address.

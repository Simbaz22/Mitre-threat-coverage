title: ESCU - Linux Sudoers Tmp File Creation - Rule
description: This analytic is to looks for file creation of sudoers.tmp file cause
  by editing /etc/sudoers using visudo or editor in linux platform. This technique
  may abuse by adversaries, malware author and red teamers to gain elevated privilege
  to targeted or compromised host. /etc/sudoers file controls who can run what commands
  as what users on what machines and can also control special things such as whether
  you need a password for particular commands. The file is composed of aliases (basically
  variables) and user specifications (which control who can run what).

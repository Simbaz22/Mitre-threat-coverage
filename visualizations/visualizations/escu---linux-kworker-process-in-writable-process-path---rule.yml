title: ESCU - Linux Kworker Process In Writable Process Path - Rule
description: This analytic looks for suspicious process kworker commandline in a linux
  machine. kworker process name or thread are common names of kernel threads in linux
  process. This hunting detections can lead to investigate process contains process
  path in writable directory in linux like /home/, /var/log and /tmp/. This technique
  was seen in cyclopsblink malware to blend its core and other of its child process
  as normal kworker on the compromised machine. This detection might be a good pivot
  to look for other IOC related to cyclopsblink malware or attacks.

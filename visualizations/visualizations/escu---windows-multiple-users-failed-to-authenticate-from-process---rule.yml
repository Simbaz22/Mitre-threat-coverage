title: ESCU - Windows Multiple Users Failed To Authenticate From Process - Rule
description: "The following analytic identifies a source process name failing to authenticate\
  \ with 30 uniquer users. This behavior could represent an adversary performing a\
  \ Password Spraying attack against an Active Directory environment to obtain initial\
  \ access or elevate privileges. Active Directory environments can be very different\
  \ depending on the organization. Users should test this detection and customize\
  \ the arbitrary threshold when needed. Event 4625 generates on domain controllers,\
  \ member servers, and workstations when an account fails to logon. Logon Type 2\
  \ describes an iteractive logon attempt.\nThis logic can be used for real time security\
  \ monitoring as well as threat hunting exercises. This detection will trigger on\
  \ the potenfially malicious host, perhaps controlled via a trojan or operated by\
  \ an insider threat, from where a password spraying attack is being executed. This\
  \ could be a domain controller as well as a member server or workstation.\nThe analytics\
  \ returned fields allow analysts to investigate the event further by providing fields\
  \ like source process name, source account and attempted user accounts."

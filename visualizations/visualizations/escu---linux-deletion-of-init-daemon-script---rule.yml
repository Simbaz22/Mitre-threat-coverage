title: ESCU - Linux Deletion Of Init Daemon Script - Rule
description: This analytic is to detect a deletion of init daemon script in a linux
  machine. daemon script that place in /etc/init.d/ is a directory that can start
  and stop some daemon services in linux machines. attacker may delete or modify daemon
  script to impair some security features or act as defense evasion in a compromised
  linux machine. This TTP can be also a good indicator of a malware trying to wipe
  or delete several files in compromised host as part of its destructive payload like
  what acidrain malware does in linux or router machines. This detection can be a
  good pivot to check what process and user tries to delete this type of files which
  is not so common and need further investigation.

title: ESCU - Exchange PowerShell Module Usage - Rule
description: "The following analytic identifies the usage of Exchange PowerShell modules\
  \ that were recently used for a proof of concept related to ProxyShell. Currently,\
  \ there is no active data shared or data we could re-produce relate to this part\
  \ of the ProxyShell chain of exploits.  \nInherently, the usage of the modules is\
  \ not malicious, but reviewing parallel processes, and user, of the session will\
  \ assist with determining the intent. \nModule - New-MailboxExportRequest will begin\
  \ the process of exporting contents of a primary mailbox or archive to a .pst file.\
  \ \nModule - New-managementroleassignment can assign a management role to a management\
  \ role group, management role assignment policy, user, or universal security group\
  \ (USG)."

title: ESCU - Anomalous usage of 7zip
description: The following detection identifies a 7z.exe spawned from `Rundll32.exe`
  or `Dllhost.exe`. It is assumed that the adversary has brought in `7z.exe` and `7z.dll`.
  It has been observed where an adversary will rename `7z.exe`. Additional coverage
  may be required to identify the behavior of renamed instances of `7z.exe`. During
  triage, identify the source of injection into `Rundll32.exe` or `Dllhost.exe`. Capture
  any files written to disk and analyze as needed. Review parallel processes for additional
  behaviors. Typically, archiving files will result in exfiltration.

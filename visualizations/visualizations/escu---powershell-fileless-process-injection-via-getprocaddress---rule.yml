title: ESCU - Powershell Fileless Process Injection via GetProcAddress - Rule
description: "The following analytic utilizes PowerShell Script Block Logging (EventCode=4104)\
  \ to identify suspicious PowerShell execution. Script Block Logging captures the\
  \ command sent to PowerShell, the full command to be executed. Upon enabling, logs\
  \ will output to Windows event logs. Dependent upon volume, enable no critical endpoints\
  \ or all. \nThis analytic identifies `GetProcAddress` in the script block. This\
  \ is not normal to be used by most PowerShell scripts and is typically unsafe/malicious.\
  \ Many attack toolkits use GetProcAddress to obtain code execution. \nIn use, `$var_gpa\
  \ = $var_unsafe_native_methods.GetMethod(GetProcAddress` and later referenced/executed\
  \ elsewhere. \nDuring triage, review parallel processes using an EDR product or\
  \ 4688 events. It will be important to understand the timeline of events around\
  \ this activity. Review the entire logged PowerShell script block."

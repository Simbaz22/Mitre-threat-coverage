title: ESCU - Linux Stdout Redirection To Dev Null File - Rule
description: This analytic looks for suspicious commandline that redirect the stdout
  or possible stderror to dev/null file. This technique was seen in cyclopsblink malware
  where it redirect the possible output or error while modify the iptables firewall
  setting of the compromised machine to hide its action from the user. This Anomaly
  detection is a good pivot to look further why process or user use this un common
  approach.

title: ESCU - Detect Renamed 7-Zip - Rule
description: The following analytic identifies renamed 7-Zip usage using Sysmon. At
  this stage of an attack, review parallel processes and file modifications for data
  that is staged or potentially have been exfiltrated. This analytic utilizes the
  OriginalFileName to capture the renamed process. During triage, validate this is
  the legitimate version of `7zip` by reviewing the PE metadata. In addition, review
  parallel processes for further suspicious behavior.

title: ESCU - Windows Terminating Lsass Process - Rule
description: This analytic is to detect a suspicious process terminating Lsass process.
  Lsass process is known to be a critical process that is responsible for enforcing
  security policy system. This process was commonly targetted by threat actor or red
  teamer to gain privilege escalation or persistence in the targeted machine because
  it handles credentials of the logon users. In this analytic we tried to detect a
  suspicious process having a granted access PROCESS_TERMINATE to lsass process to
  modify or delete protected registrys. This technique was seen in doublezero malware
  that tries to wipe files and registry in compromised hosts. This anomaly detection
  can be a good pivot of incident response for possible credential dumping or evading
  security policy in a host or network environment.

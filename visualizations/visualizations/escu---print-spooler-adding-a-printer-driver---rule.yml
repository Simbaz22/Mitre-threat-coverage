title: ESCU - Print Spooler Adding A Printer Driver - Rule
description: "The following analytic identifies new printer drivers being load by\
  \ utilizing the Windows PrintService operational logs, EventCode 316. This was identified\
  \ during our testing of CVE-2021-34527 previously (CVE-2021-1675) or PrintNightmare.\
  \ \nWithin the proof of concept code, the following event will occur - \"Printer\
  \ driver 1234 for Windows x64 Version-3 was added or updated. Files:- UNIDRV.DLL,\
  \ kernelbase.dll, evil.dll. No user action is required.\" \nDuring triage, isolate\
  \ the endpoint and review for source of exploitation. Capture any additional file\
  \ modification events and review the source of where the exploitation began."

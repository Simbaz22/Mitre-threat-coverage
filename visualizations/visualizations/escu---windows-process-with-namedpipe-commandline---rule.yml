title: ESCU - Windows Process With NamedPipe CommandLine - Rule
description: This analytic is to look for process commandline that contains named
  pipe. This technique was seen in some adversaries, threat actor and malware like
  olympic destroyer to communicate to its other child processes after process injection
  that serve as defense evasion and privilege escalation. On the other hand this analytic
  may catch some normal process that using this technique for example browser application.
  In that scenario we include common process path we've seen during testing that cause
  false positive which is the program files. False positive may still be arise if
  the normal application is in other folder path.

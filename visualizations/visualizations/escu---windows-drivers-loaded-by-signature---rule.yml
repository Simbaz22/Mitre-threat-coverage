title: ESCU - Windows Drivers Loaded by Signature - Rule
description: The following analytic assists with viewing all drivers being loaded
  by using Sysmon EventCode 6 (Driver Load). Sysmon provides some simple fields to
  assist with identifying suspicious drivers. Use this analytic to look at prevalence
  of driver (count), path of driver, signature status and hash. Review these fields
  with scrutiny until the ability to prove the driver is legitimate and has a purpose
  in the environment.

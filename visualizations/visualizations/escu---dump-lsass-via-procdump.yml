title: ESCU - Dump LSASS via procdump
description: "Detect procdump.exe dumping the lsass process. This query looks for\
  \ both -mm and -ma usage. -mm will produce a mini dump file and -ma will write a\
  \ dump file with all process memory. Both are highly suspect and should be reviewed.\
  \ This query does not monitor for the internal name (original_file_name=procdump)\
  \ of the PE or look for procdump64.exe. Modify the query as needed.\n\nDuring triage,\
  \ confirm this is procdump.exe executing. If it is the first time a Sysinternals\
  \ utility has been ran, it is possible there will be a -accepteula on the command\
  \ line. Review other endpoint data sources for cross process (injection) into lsass.exe."

title: ESCU - Windows Registry Certificate Added - Rule
description: The following analytic identifies installation of a root CA certificate
  by monitoring the registry. The base paths may be found [here](https://gist.github.com/mattifestation/75d6117707bcf8c26845b3cbb6ad2b6b/raw/ae65ef15c706140ffc2e165615204e20f2903028/RootCAInstallationDetection.xml).
  In short, there are specific certificate registry paths that will be written to
  (SetValue) when a new certificate is added. The high-fidelity events to pay attention
  to are SetValue events where the TargetObject property ends with "<THUMBPRINT_VALUE>\Blob"
  as this indicates the direct installation or modification of a root certificate
  binary blob. The other high fidelity reference will be which process is making the
  registry modifications. There are very few processes that modify these day to day,
  therefore monitoring for all to start (hunting) provides a great beginning.

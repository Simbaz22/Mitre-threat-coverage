title: ESCU - Services Escalate Exe - Rule
description: The following analytic identifies the use of `svc-exe` with Cobalt Strike.
  The behavior typically follows after an adversary has already gained initial access
  and is escalating privileges. Using `svc-exe`, a randomly named binary will be downloaded
  from the remote Teamserver and placed on disk within `C:\Windows\400619a.exe`. Following,
  the binary will be added to the registry under key `HKLM\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\400619a\`
  with multiple keys and values added to look like a legitimate service. Upon loading,
  `services.exe` will spawn the randomly named binary from `\\127.0.0.1\ADMIN$\400619a.exe`.
  The process lineage is completed with `400619a.exe` spawning rundll32.exe, which
  is the default `spawnto_` value for Cobalt Strike. The `spawnto_` value is arbitrary
  and may be any process on disk (typically system32/syswow64 binary). The `spawnto_`
  process will also contain a network connection. During triage, review parallel procesess
  and identify any additional file modifications.

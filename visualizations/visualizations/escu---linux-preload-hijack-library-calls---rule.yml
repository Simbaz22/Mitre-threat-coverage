title: ESCU - Linux Preload Hijack Library Calls - Rule
description: This analytic is to detect a suspicious command that may hijack a library
  function in linux platform. This technique is commonly abuse by adversaries, malware
  author and red teamers to gain privileges and persist on the machine. This detection
  pertains to loading a dll to hijack or hook a library function of specific program
  using LD_PRELOAD command.

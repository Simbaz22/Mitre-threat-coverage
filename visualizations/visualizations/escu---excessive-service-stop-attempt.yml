title: ESCU - Excessive Service Stop Attempt
description: This analytic identifies suspicious series of attempt to kill multiple
  services on a system using either `net.exe` or `sc.exe`. This technique is use by
  adversaries to terminate security services or other related services to continue
  there objective and evade detections.

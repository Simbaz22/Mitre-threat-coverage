title: ESCU - Winword Spawning Cmd - Rule
description: The following detection identifies Microsoft Word spawning `cmd.exe`.
  Typically, this is not common behavior and not default with winword.exe. Winword.exe
  will generally be found in the following path `C:\Program Files\Microsoft Office\root\Office16`
  (version will vary). Cmd.exe spawning from winword.exe is common for a spearphishing
  attachment and is actively used. Albeit, the command-line will indicate what is
  being executed. During triage, review parallel processes and identify any files
  that may have been written. It is possible that COM is utilized to trampoline the
  child process to `explorer.exe` or `wmiprvse.exe`.

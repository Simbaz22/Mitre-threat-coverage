title: ESCU - CertUtil Download With VerifyCtl and Split Arguments - Rule
description: Certutil.exe may download a file from a remote destination using `-VerifyCtl`.
  This behavior does require a URL to be passed on the command-line. In addition,
  `-f` (force) and `-split` (Split embedded ASN.1 elements, and save to files) will
  be used. It is not entirely common for `certutil.exe` to contact public IP space.
  \ During triage, capture any files on disk and review. Review the reputation of
  the remote IP or domain in question. Using `-VerifyCtl`, the file will either be
  written to the current working directory or `%APPDATA%\..\LocalLow\Microsoft\CryptnetUrlCache\Content\<hash>`.

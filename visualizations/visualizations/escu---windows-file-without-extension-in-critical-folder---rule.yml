title: ESCU - Windows File Without Extension In Critical Folder - Rule
description: This analytic is to look for suspicious file creation in the critical
  folder like "System32\Drivers" folder without file extension. This artifacts was
  seen in latest hermeticwiper where it drops its driver component in Driver Directory
  both the compressed(without file extension) and the actual driver component (with
  .sys file extension). This TTP is really a good indication that a host might be
  compromised by this destructive malware that wipes the boot sector of the system.

title: ESCU - MSI Module Loaded by Non-System Binary - Rule
description: "The following hunting analytic identifies `msi.dll` being loaded by\
  \ a binary not located in `system32`, `syswow64`, `winsxs` or `windows` paths. This\
  \ behavior is most recently related to InstallerFileTakeOver, or CVE-2021-41379,\
  \ and DLL side-loading. CVE-2021-41379 requires a binary to be dropped and `msi.dll`\
  \ to be loaded by it. To Successful exploitation of this issue happens in four parts\
  \ \n1. Generation of an MSI that will trigger bad behavior. \n1. Preparing a directory\
  \ for MSI installation. \n1. Inducing an error state. \n1. Racing to introduce a\
  \ junction and a symlink to trick msiexec.exe to modify the attacker specified file.\
  \ \nIn addition, `msi.dll` has been abused in DLL side-loading attacks by being\
  \ loaded by non-system binaries."

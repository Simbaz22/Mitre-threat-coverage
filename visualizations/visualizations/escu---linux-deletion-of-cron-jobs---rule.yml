title: ESCU - Linux Deletion Of Cron Jobs - Rule
description: This analytic is to detect a deletion of cron job in a linux machine.
  This technique can be related to an attacker, threat actor or malware to disable
  scheduled cron jobs that might be related to security or to evade some detections.
  We also saw that this technique can be a good indicator for malware that is trying
  to wipe or delete several files on the compromised host like the acidrain malware.
  This anomaly detection can be a good pivot detection to look for process and user
  doing it why they doing. Take note that this event can be done by administrator
  so filtering on those possible false positive event is needed.

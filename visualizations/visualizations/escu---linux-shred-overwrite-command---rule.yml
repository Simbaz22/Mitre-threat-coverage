title: ESCU - Linux Shred Overwrite Command - Rule
description: This analytic is to detect a shred process to overwrite a files in a
  linux machine. Shred Linux application is designed to overwrite file to hide its
  contents or make the deleted file un-recoverable. Weve seen this technique in industroyer2
  malware that tries to wipe energy facilities of targeted sector as part of its destructive
  attack. It might be some normal user may use this command for valid purposes but
  it is recommended to check what files, disk or folder it tries to shred that might
  be good pivot for incident response in this type of destructive malware.

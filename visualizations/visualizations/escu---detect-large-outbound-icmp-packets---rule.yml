title: ESCU - Detect Large Outbound ICMP Packets - Rule
description: This search looks for outbound ICMP packets with a packet size larger
  than 1,000 bytes. Various threat actors have been known to use ICMP as a command
  and control channel for their attack infrastructure. Large ICMP packets from an
  endpoint to a remote host may be indicative of this activity.

title: ESCU - Remote System Discovery with Net - Rule
description: This analytic looks for the execution of `net.exe` or `net1.exe` with
  command-line arguments utilized to discover remote systems. The argument `domain
  computers /domain` returns a list of all domain computers. Red Teams and adversaries
  alike use net.exe to identify remote systems for situational awareness and Active
  Directory Discovery.

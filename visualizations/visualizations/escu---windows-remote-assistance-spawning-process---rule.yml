title: ESCU - Windows Remote Assistance Spawning Process - Rule
description: The following analytic identifies the use of Microsoft Remote Assistance,
  msra.exe, spawning PowerShell.exe or cmd.exe as a child process. Msra.exe by default
  has no command-line arguments and typically spawns itself. It will generate a network
  connection to the remote system that is connected. This behavior is indicative of
  another process injected into msra.exe. Review the parent process or cross process
  events to identify source.

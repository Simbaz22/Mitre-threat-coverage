title: ESCU - Possible Lateral Movement PowerShell Spawn - Rule
description: The following analytic assists with identifying a PowerShell process
  spawned as a child or grand child process of commonly abused processes during lateral
  movement techniques including `services.exe`, `wmiprsve.exe`, `svchost.exe`, `wsmprovhost.exe`
  and `mmc.exe`. Legitimate Windows features such as the Service Control Manager,
  Windows Management Instrumentation, Task Scheduler, Windows Remote Management and
  the DCOM protocol can be abused to start a process on a remote endpoint. Looking
  for PowerShell spawned out of this processes may reveal a lateral movement attack.
  Red Teams and adversaries alike may abuse these services during a breach for lateral
  movement and remote code execution.

title: ESCU - Web JSP Request via URL - Rule
description: The following analytic identifies the common URL requests used by a recent
  CVE - CVE-2022-22965, or Spring4Shell, to access a webshell on the remote webserver.
  The filename and cmd are arbitrary in this exploitation. Java will write a JSP to
  disk and a process will spawn from Java based on the cmd passed. This is indicative
  of typical web shell activity.

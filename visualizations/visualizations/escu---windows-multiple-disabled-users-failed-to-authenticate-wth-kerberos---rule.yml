title: ESCU - Windows Multiple Disabled Users Failed To Authenticate Wth Kerberos
  - Rule
description: '"The following analytic identifies one source endpoint failing to authenticate
  with multiple disabled domain users using the Kerberos protocol. This behavior could
  represent an adversary performing a Password Spraying attack against an Active Directory
  environment using Kerberos to obtain initial access or elevate privileges. As attackers
  progress in a breach, mistakes will be made. In certain scenarios, adversaries may
  execute a password spraying attack against disabled users. Event 4768 is generated
  every time the Key Distribution Center issues a Kerberos Ticket Granting Ticket
  (TGT). Failure code `0x12` stands for `clients credentials have been revoked` (account
  disabled, expired or locked out). The detection calculates the standard deviation
  for each host and leverages the 3-sigma statistical rule to identify an unusual
  number of users. To customize this analytic, users can try different combinations
  of the `bucket` span time and the calculation of the `upperBound` field. This logic
  can be used for real time security monitoring as well as threat hunting exercises.
  This detection will only trigger on domain controllers, not on member servers or
  workstations. The analytics returned fields allow analysts to investigate the event
  further by providing fields like source ip and attempted user accounts."'

title: ESCU - Suspicious Powershell Command-Line Arguments - Rule
description: 'WARNING, this detection has been marked deprecated by the Splunk Threat
  Research team, this means that it will no longer be maintained or supported. If
  you have any questions feel free to email us at: research@splunk.com. This search
  looks for PowerShell processes started with a base64 encoded command-line passed
  to it, with parameters to modify the execution policy for the process, and those
  that prevent the display of an interactive prompt to the user. This combination
  of command-line options is suspicious because it overrides the default PowerShell
  execution policy, attempts to hide itself from the user, and passes an encoded script
  to be run on the command-line. Deprecated because almost the same as Malicious PowerShell
  Process - Encoded Command'

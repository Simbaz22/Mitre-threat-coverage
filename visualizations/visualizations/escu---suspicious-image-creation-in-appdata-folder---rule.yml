title: ESCU - Suspicious Image Creation In Appdata Folder - Rule
description: This search is to detect a suspicious creation of image in appdata folder
  made by process that also has a file reference in appdata folder. This technique
  was seen in remcos rat that capture screenshot of the compromised machine and place
  it in the appdata and will be send to its C2 server. This TTP is really a good indicator
  to check that process because it is in suspicious folder path and image files are
  not commonly created by user in this folder path.

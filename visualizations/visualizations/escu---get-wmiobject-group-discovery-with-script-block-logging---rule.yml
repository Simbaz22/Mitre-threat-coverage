title: ESCU - Get WMIObject Group Discovery with Script Block Logging - Rule
description: "The following analytic utilizes PowerShell Script Block Logging (EventCode=4104)\
  \ to identify suspicious PowerShell execution. Script Block Logging captures the\
  \ command sent to PowerShell, the full command to be executed. Upon enabling, logs\
  \ will output to Windows event logs. Dependent upon volume, enable on critical endpoints\
  \ or all. \nThis analytic identifies the usage of `Get-WMIObject Win32_Group`, which\
  \ is typically used as a way to identify groups on the endpoint.  Typically, by\
  \ itself, is not malicious but may raise suspicion based on time of day, endpoint\
  \ and username. \nDuring triage, review parallel processes using an EDR product\
  \ or 4688 events. It will be important to understand the timeline of events around\
  \ this activity. Review the entire logged PowerShell script block."

title: ESCU - Linux File Created In Kernel Driver Directory - Rule
description: This analytic looks for suspicious file creation in kernel/driver directory
  in linux platform. This directory is known folder for all linux kernel module available
  within the system. so creation of file in this directory is a good indicator that
  there is a possible rootkit installation in the host machine. This technique was
  abuse by adversaries, malware author and red teamers to gain high privileges to
  their malicious code such us in kernel level. Even this event is not so common administrator
  or legitimate 3rd party tool may install driver or linux kernel module as part of
  its installation.

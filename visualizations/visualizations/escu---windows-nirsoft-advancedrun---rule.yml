description: The following analytic identifies the use of AdvancedRun.exe. AdvancedRun.exe
  has similar capabilities as other remote programs like psexec. AdvancedRun may also
  ingest a configuration file with all settings defined and perform its activity.
  The analytic is written in a way to identify a renamed binary and also the common
  command-line arguments.

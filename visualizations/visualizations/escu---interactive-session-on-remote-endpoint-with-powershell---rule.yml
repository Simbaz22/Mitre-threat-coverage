title: ESCU - Interactive Session on Remote Endpoint with PowerShell - Rule
description: The following analytic utilizes PowerShell Script Block Logging (EventCode=4104)
  to identify the usage of the `Enter-PSSession`. This commandlet can be used to open
  an interactive session on a remote endpoint leveraging the WinRM protocol. Red Teams
  and adversaries alike may abuse WinRM and `Enter-PSSession` for lateral movement
  and remote code execution.

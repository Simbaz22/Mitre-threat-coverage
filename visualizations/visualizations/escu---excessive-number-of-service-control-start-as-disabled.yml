title: ESCU - Excessive number of service control start as disabled
description: This detection targets behaviors observed when threat actors have used
  sc.exe to modify services. We observed malware in a honey pot spawning numerous
  sc.exe processes in a short period of time, presumably to impair defenses, possibly
  to block others from compromising the same machine.  This detection will alert when
  we see both an excessive number of sc.exe processes launched with specific commandline
  arguments to disable the start of certain services.

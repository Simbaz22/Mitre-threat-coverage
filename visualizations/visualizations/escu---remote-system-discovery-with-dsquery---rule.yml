title: ESCU - Remote System Discovery with Dsquery - Rule
description: This analytic looks for the execution of `dsquery.exe` with command-line
  arguments utilized to discover remote systems. The `computer` argument returns a
  list of all computers registered in the domain. Red Teams and adversaries alike
  engage in remote system discovery for situational awareness and Active Directory

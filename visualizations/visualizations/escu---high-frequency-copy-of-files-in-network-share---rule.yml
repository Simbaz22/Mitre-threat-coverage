title: ESCU - High Frequency Copy Of Files In Network Share - Rule
description: This analytic is to detect a suspicious high frequency copying/moving
  of files in network share as part of information sabotage. This anomaly event can
  be a good indicator of insider trying to sabotage data by transfering classified
  or internal files within network share to exfitrate it after or to lure evidence
  of insider attack to other user. This behavior may catch several noise if network
  share is a common place for classified or internal document processing.

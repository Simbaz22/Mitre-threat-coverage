title: ESCU - Linux Service File Created In Systemd Directory - Rule
description: This analytic looks for suspicious file creation in systemd timer directory
  in linux platform. systemd is a system and service manager for Linux distributions.
  From the Windows perspective, this process fulfills the duties of wininit.exe and
  services.exe combined. At the risk of simplifying the functionality of systemd,
  it initializes a Linux system and starts relevant services that are defined in service
  unit files. Adversaries, malware and red teamers may abuse this this feature by
  stashing systemd service file to persist on the targetted or compromised host.

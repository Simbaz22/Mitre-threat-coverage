title: ESCU - Unusual Number of Remote Endpoint Authentication Events - Rule
description: "The following hunting analytic leverages Event ID 4624, `An account\
  \ was successfully logged on`, to identify an unusual number of remote authentication\
  \ attempts coming from one source. An endpoint authenticating to a large number\
  \ of remote endpoints could represent malicious behavior like lateral movement,\
  \ malware staging, reconnaissance, etc.\nThe detection calculates the standard deviation\
  \ for each host and leverages the 3-sigma statistical rule to identify an unusual\
  \ high number of authentication events. To customize this analytic, users can try\
  \ different combinations of the `bucket` span time,  the calculation of the `upperBound`\
  \ field as well as the Outlier calculation. This logic can be used for real time\
  \ security monitoring as well as threat hunting exercises."

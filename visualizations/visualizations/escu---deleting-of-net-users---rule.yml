title: ESCU - Deleting Of Net Users - Rule
description: This analytic will detect a suspicious net.exe/net1.exe command-line
  to delete a user on a system. This technique may be use by an administrator for
  legitimate purposes, however this behavior has been used in the wild to impair some
  user or deleting adversaries tracks created during its lateral movement additional
  systems. During triage, review parallel processes for additional behavior. Identify
  any other user accounts created before or after.

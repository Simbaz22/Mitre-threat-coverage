title: ESCU - Vbscript Execution Using Wscript App - Rule
description: This analytic is to detect a suspicious wscript commandline to execute
  vbscript. This technique was seen in several malware to execute malicious vbs file
  using wscript application. commonly vbs script is associated to cscript process
  and this can be a technique to evade process parent child detections or even some
  av script emulation system.

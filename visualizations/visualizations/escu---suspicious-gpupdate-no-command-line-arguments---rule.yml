title: ESCU - Suspicious GPUpdate no Command Line Arguments - Rule
description: The following analytic identifies gpupdate.exe with no command line arguments.
  It is unusual for gpupdate.exe to execute with no command line arguments present.
  This particular behavior is common with malicious software, including Cobalt Strike.
  During investigation, identify any network connections and parallel processes. Identify
  any suspicious module loads related to credential dumping or file writes. gpupdate.exe
  is natively found in C:\Windows\system32 and C:\Windows\syswow64.

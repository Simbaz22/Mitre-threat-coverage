title: ESCU - Powershell Fileless Script Contains Base64 Encoded Content - Rule
description: "The following analytic utilizes PowerShell Script Block Logging (EventCode=4104)\
  \ to identify suspicious PowerShell execution. Script Block Logging captures the\
  \ command sent to PowerShell, the full command to be executed. Upon enabling, logs\
  \ will output to Windows event logs. Dependent upon volume, enable on critical endpoints\
  \ or all. \nThis analytic identifies `FromBase64String` within the script block.\
  \ A typical malicious instance will include additional code. \nCommand example -\
  \ `[Byte[]]$var_code = [System.Convert]::FromBase64String(38uqIyMjQ6rG....` \nDuring\
  \ triage, review parallel processes using an EDR product or 4688 events. It will\
  \ be important to understand the timeline of events around this activity. Review\
  \ the entire logged PowerShell script block."

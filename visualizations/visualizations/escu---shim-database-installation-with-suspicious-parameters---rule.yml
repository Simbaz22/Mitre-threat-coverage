title: ESCU - Shim Database Installation With Suspicious Parameters - Rule
description: This search detects the process execution and arguments required to silently
  create a shim database.  The sdbinst.exe application is used to install shim database
  files (.sdb). A shim is a small library which transparently intercepts an API, changes
  the parameters passed, handles the operation itself, or redirects the operation
  elsewhere.

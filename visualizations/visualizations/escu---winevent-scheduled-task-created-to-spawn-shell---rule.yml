title: ESCU - WinEvent Scheduled Task Created to Spawn Shell - Rule
description: '"The following query utilizes Windows Security EventCode 4698, `A scheduled
  task was created`, to identify suspicious tasks registered on Windows either via
  schtasks.exe OR TaskService with a command to be executed with a native Windows
  shell (PowerShell, Cmd, Wscript, Cscript). The search will return the first time
  and last time the task was registered, as well as the `Command` to be executed,
  `Task Name`, `Author`, `Enabled`, and whether it is `Hidden` or not. schtasks.exe
  is natively found in `C:\Windows\system32` and `C:\Windows\syswow64`. The following
  DLL(s) are loaded when schtasks.exe or TaskService is launched -`taskschd.dll`.
  If found loaded by another process, it is possible a scheduled task is being registered
  within that process context in memory. Upon triage, identify the task scheduled
  source. Was it schtasks.exe or via TaskService? Review the job created and the Command
  to be executed. Capture any artifacts on disk and review. Identify any parallel
  processes within the same timeframe to identify source."'

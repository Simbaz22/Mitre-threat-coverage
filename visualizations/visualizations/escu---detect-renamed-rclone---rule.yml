title: ESCU - Detect Renamed RClone - Rule
description: The following analytic identifies the usage of `rclone.exe`, renamed,
  being used to exfiltrate data to a remote destination. RClone has been used by multiple
  ransomware groups to exfiltrate data. In many instances, it will be downloaded from
  the legitimate site and executed accordingly. During triage, isolate the endpoint
  and begin to review parallel processes for additional behavior. At this stage, the
  adversary may have staged data to be exfiltrated.

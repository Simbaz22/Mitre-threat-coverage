title: ESCU - Office Product Spawning CertUtil - Rule
description: The following detection identifies the latest behavior utilized by different
  malware families (including TA551, IcedID). This detection identifies any Windows
  Office Product spawning `certutil.exe`. In malicious instances, the command-line
  of `certutil.exe` will contain a URL to a remote destination. In addition, Threat
  Research has released a detections identifying suspicious use of `certutil.exe`.
  In this instance, we narrow our detection down to the Office suite as a parent process.
  During triage, review all file modifications. Capture and analyze any artifacts
  on disk. The Office Product, or `certutil.exe` will have reached out to a remote
  destination, capture and block the IPs or domain. Review additional parallel processes
  for further activity.

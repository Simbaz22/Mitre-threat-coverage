title: ESCU - Windows PowerShell WMI Win32_ScheduledJob
description: The following analytic detects the use of the PowerShell script block
  logging mechanism to detect the use of the Win32_ScheduledJob WMI class. This class
  allows the creation and management of scheduled tasks on Windows systems. However,
  due to security concerns, the class has been disabled by default in Windows systems,
  and its use must be explicitly enabled by modifying the registry. As a result, the
  detection of the use of this class may indicate malicious activity, especially if
  the class was enabled on the system by the attacker. Therefore, it is recommended
  to monitor the use of Win32_ScheduledJob through PowerShell script block logging
  and to investigate any suspicious activity.

title: ESCU - Linux High Frequency Of File Deletion In Boot Folder - Rule
description: This analytic is to detect a high frequency of file deletion relative
  to process name and process id /boot/ folder. These events was seen in industroyer2
  wiper malware where it tries to delete all files in a critical directory in linux
  directory. This detection already contains some filter that might cause false positive
  during our testing.

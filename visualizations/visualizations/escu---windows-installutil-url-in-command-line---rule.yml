title: ESCU - Windows InstallUtil URL in Command Line - Rule
description: "The following analytic identifies the Windows InstallUtil.exe binary\
  \ passing a HTTP request on the command-line. This technique may be used to download\
  \ and execute code while bypassing application control. \nWhen `InstallUtil.exe`\
  \ is used in a malicous manner, the path to an executable on the filesystem is typically\
  \ specified. Take note of the parent process. In a suspicious instance, this will\
  \ be spawned from a non-standard process like `Cmd.exe`, `PowerShell.exe` or `Explorer.exe`.\
  \ \nIf used by a developer, typically this will be found with multiple command-line\
  \ switches/arguments and spawn from Visual Studio. \nDuring triage review resulting\
  \ network connections, file modifications, and parallel processes. Capture any artifacts\
  \ and review further."

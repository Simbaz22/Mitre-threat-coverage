title: ESCU - Suspicious Kerberos Service Ticket Request - Rule
description: As part of the sAMAccountName Spoofing (CVE-2021-42278) and Domain Controller
  Impersonation (CVE-2021-42287) exploitation chain, adversaries will request and
  obtain a Kerberos Service Ticket (TGS) with a domain controller computer account
  as the Service Name. This Service Ticket can be then used to take control of the
  domain controller on the final part of the attack. This analytic leverages Event
  Id 4769, `A Kerberos service ticket was requested`, to identify an unusual TGS request
  where the Account_Name requesting the ticket matches the Service_Name field. This
  behavior could represent an exploitation attempt of CVE-2021-42278 and CVE-2021-42287
  for privilege escalation.

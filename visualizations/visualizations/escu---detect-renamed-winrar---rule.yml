title: ESCU - Detect Renamed WinRAR - Rule
description: The following analtyic identifies renamed instances of `WinRAR.exe`.
  In most cases, it is not common for WinRAR to be used renamed, however it is common
  to be installed by a third party application and executed from a non-standard path.
  During triage, validate additional metadata from the binary that this is `WinRAR`.
  Review parallel processes and file modifications.

title: ESCU - Windows Multiple Users Failed To Authenticate From Host Using NTLM -
  Rule
description: "The following analytic identifies one source endpoint failing to authenticate\
  \ with 30 unique invalid users using the NTLM protocol. This behavior could represent\
  \ an adversary performing a Password Spraying attack against an Active Directory\
  \ environment using NTLM to obtain initial access or elevate privileges. Active\
  \ Directory environments can be very different depending on the organization. Users\
  \ should test this detection and customize the arbitrary threshold when needed.\
  \ As attackers progress in a breach, mistakes will be made. In certain scenarios,\
  \ adversaries may execute a password spraying attack using an invalid list of users.\
  \ Event 4776 is generated on the computer that is authoritative for the provided\
  \ credentials. For domain accounts, the domain controller is authoritative. For\
  \ local accounts, the local computer is authoritative. Error code 0xC0000064 stands\
  \ for `The username you typed does not exist` (the attempted user is a legitimate\
  \ domain user).\nThis logic can be used for real time security monitoring as well\
  \ as threat hunting exercises. This detection will only trigger on domain controllers,\
  \ not on member servers or workstations.\nThe analytics returned fields allow analysts\
  \ to investigate the event further by providing fields like source workstation name\
  \ and attempted user accounts."

title: ESCU - Gsuite Email Suspicious Subject With Attachment - Rule
description: This search is to detect a gsuite email contains suspicious subject having
  known file type used in spear phishing. This technique is a common and effective
  entry vector of attacker to compromise a network by luring the user to click or
  execute the suspicious attachment send from external email account because of the
  effective social engineering of subject related to delivery, bank and so on. On
  the other hand this detection may catch a normal email traffic related to legitimate
  transaction so better to check the email sender, spelling and etc. avoid click link
  or opening the attachment if you are not expecting this type of e-mail.

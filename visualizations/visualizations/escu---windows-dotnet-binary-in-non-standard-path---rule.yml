title: ESCU - Windows DotNet Binary in Non Standard Path - Rule
description: The following analytic identifies native .net binaries within the Windows
  operating system that may be abused by adversaries by moving it to a new directory.
  The analytic identifies the .net binary by using a lookup and compares the process
  name and original file name (internal name). The analytic utilizes a lookup with
  the is_net_windows_file macro to identify the binary process name and original file
  name. if one or the other matches an alert will be generated. Adversaries abuse
  these binaries as they are native to windows and native DotNet. Note that not all
  SDK (post install of Windows) are captured in the lookup.

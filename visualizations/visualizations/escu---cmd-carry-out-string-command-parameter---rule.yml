title: ESCU - CMD Carry Out String Command Parameter - Rule
description: The following analytic identifies command-line arguments where `cmd.exe
  /c` is used to execute a program. `cmd /c` is used to run commands in MS-DOS and
  terminate after command or process completion. This technique is commonly seen in
  adversaries and malware to execute batch command using different shell like PowerShell
  or different process other than `cmd.exe`. This is a good hunting query for suspicious
  command-line made by a script or relative process execute it.

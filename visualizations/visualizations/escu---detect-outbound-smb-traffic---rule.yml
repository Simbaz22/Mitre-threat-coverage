title: ESCU - Detect Outbound SMB Traffic - Rule
description: This search looks for outbound SMB connections made by hosts within your
  network to the Internet. SMB traffic is used for Windows file-sharing activity.
  One of the techniques often used by attackers involves retrieving the credential
  hash using an SMB request made to a compromised server controlled by the threat
  actor.

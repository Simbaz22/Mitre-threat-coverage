title: ESCU - CSC Net On The Fly Compilation - Rule
description: this analytic is to detect a suspicious compile before delivery approach
  of .net compiler csc.exe. This technique was seen in several adversaries, malware
  and even in red teams to take advantage the csc.exe .net compiler tool to compile
  on the fly a malicious .net code to evade detection from security product. This
  is a good hunting query to check further the file or process created after this
  event and check the file path that passed to csc.exe which is the .net code. Aside
  from that, powershell is capable of using this compiler in executing .net code in
  a powershell script so filter on that case is needed.

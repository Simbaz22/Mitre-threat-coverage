title: ESCU - Windows Non-System Account Targeting Lsass - Rule
description: The following analytic identifies non SYSTEM accounts requesting access
  to lsass.exe. This behavior may be related to credential dumping or applications
  requiring access to credentials. Triaging this event will require understanding
  the GrantedAccess from the SourceImage. In addition, whether the account is privileged
  or not. Review the process requesting permissions and review parallel processes.

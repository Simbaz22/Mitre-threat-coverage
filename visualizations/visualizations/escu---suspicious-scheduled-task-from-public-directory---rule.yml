title: ESCU - Suspicious Scheduled Task from Public Directory - Rule
description: The following detection identifies Scheduled Tasks registering (creating
  a new task) a binary or script to run from a public directory which includes users\public,
  \programdata\ and \windows\temp. Upon triage, review the binary or script in the
  command line for legitimacy, whether an approved binary/script or not. In addition,
  capture the binary or script in question and analyze for further behaviors. Identify
  the source and contain the endpoint.

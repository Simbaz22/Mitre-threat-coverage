title: ESCU - Windows Command and Scripting Interpreter Path Traversal Exec - Rule
description: The following analytic identifies path traversal commandline execution.
  This technique was seen in malicious document that execute malicious code using
  msdt.exe and path traversal technique that serve as defense evasion. This TTP is
  a good pivot to look for more suspicious process and commandline that runs before
  and after this execution. This may help you to find possible downloaded malware
  or other lolbin execution.

title: ESCU - Winword Spawning Windows Script Host - Rule
description: The following detection identifies Microsoft Winword.exe spawning Windows
  Script Host - `cscript.exe` or `wscript.exe`. Typically, this is not common behavior
  and not default with Winword.exe. Winword.exe will generally be found in the following
  path `C:\Program Files\Microsoft Office\root\Office16` (version will vary). `cscript.exe`
  or `wscript.exe` default location is `c:\windows\system32\` or c:windows\syswow64\`.
  `cscript.exe` or `wscript.exe` spawning from Winword.exe is common for a spearphishing
  attachment and is actively used. Albeit, the command-line executed will most likely
  be obfuscated and captured via another detection. During triage, review parallel
  processes and identify any files that may have been written. Review the reputation
  of the remote destination and block accordingly.

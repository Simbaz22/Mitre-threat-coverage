title: ESCU - Mimikatz PassTheTicket CommandLine Parameters - Rule
description: The following analytic looks for the use of Mimikatz command line parameters
  leveraged to execute pass the ticket attacks. Red teams and adversaries alike may
  use the pass the ticket technique using stolen Kerberos tickets to move laterally
  within an environment, bypassing normal system access controls. Defenders should
  be aware that adversaries may customize the source code of Mimikatz and modify the
  command line parameters. This would effectively bypass this analytic.

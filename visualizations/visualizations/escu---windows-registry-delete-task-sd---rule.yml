title: ESCU - Windows Registry Delete Task SD - Rule
description: The following analytic identifies a process attempting to delete a scheduled
  task SD (Security Descriptor) from within the registry path of that task. This may
  occur from a non-standard process running and may not come from reg.exe. This particular
  behavior will remove the actual Task Name from the Task Scheduler GUI and from the
  command-line query - schtasks.exe /query. In addition, in order to perform this
  action, the user context will need to be SYSTEM.

title: ESCU - Detect AzureHound File Modifications - Rule
description: The following analytic is similar to SharpHound file modifications, but
  this instance covers the use of Invoke-AzureHound. AzureHound is the SharpHound
  equivilent but for Azure. It's possible this may never be seen in an environment
  as most attackers may execute this tool remotely. Once execution is complete, a
  zip file with a similar name will drop `20210601090751-azurecollection.zip`. In
  addition to the zip, multiple .json files will be written to disk, which are in
  the zip.

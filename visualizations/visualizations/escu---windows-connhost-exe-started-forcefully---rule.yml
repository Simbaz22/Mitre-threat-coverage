title: ESCU - Windows connhost exe started forcefully - Rule
description: 'WARNING, this detection has been marked deprecated by the Splunk Threat
  Research team, this means that it will no longer be maintained or supported. If
  you have any questions feel free to email us at: research@splunk.com. The search
  looks for the Console Window Host process (connhost.exe) executed using the force
  flag -ForceV1. This is not regular behavior in the Windows OS and is often seen
  executed by the Ryuk Ransomware. DEPRECATED This event is actually seen in the windows
  10 client of attack_range_local. After further testing we realized this is not specific
  to Ryuk.'

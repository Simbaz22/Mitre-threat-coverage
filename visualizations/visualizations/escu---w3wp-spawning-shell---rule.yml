title: ESCU - W3WP Spawning Shell - Rule
description: This query identifies a shell, PowerShell.exe or Cmd.exe, spawning from
  W3WP.exe, or IIS. In addition to IIS logs, this behavior with an EDR product will
  capture potential webshell activity, similar to the HAFNIUM Group abusing CVEs,
  on publicly available Exchange mail servers. During triage, review the parent process
  and child process of the shell being spawned. Review the command-line arguments
  and any file modifications that may occur. Identify additional parallel process,
  child processes, that may highlight further commands executed. After triaging, work
  to contain the threat and patch the system that is vulnerable.

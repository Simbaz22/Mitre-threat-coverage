title: ESCU - ServicePrincipalNames Discovery with SetSPN - Rule
description: "The following analytic identifies `setspn.exe` usage related to querying\
  \ the domain for Service Principle Names. typically, this is a precursor activity\
  \ related to kerberoasting or the silver ticket attack. \nWhat is a ServicePrincipleName?\
  \ \nA service principal name (SPN) is a unique identifier of a service instance.\
  \ SPNs are used by Kerberos authentication to associate a service instance with\
  \ a service logon account. This allows a client application to request that the\
  \ service authenticate an account even if the client does not have the account name.\n\
  Example usage includes the following \n1. setspn -T offense -Q */* 1. setspn -T\
  \ attackrange.local -F -Q MSSQLSvc/* 1. setspn -Q */* > allspns.txt 1. setspn -q\
  \ \nValues \n1. -F = perform queries at the forest, rather than domain level 1.\
  \ -T = perform query on the specified domain or forest (when -F is also used) 1.\
  \ -Q = query for existence of SPN \nDuring triage, review parallel processes for\
  \ further suspicious activity."

title: ESCU - Windows Enable Win32_ScheduledJob via Registry
description: 'This analytic searches for a registry modification that enables the
  use of the at.exe or wmi Win32_ScheduledJob command to add scheduled tasks on a
  Windows endpoint. Specifically, it looks for the creation of a new DWORD value named
  "EnableAt" in the following registry path: "HKLM:\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Schedule\Configuration".
  If this value is set to 1, it enables the at.exe and wmi Win32_ScheduledJob commands
  to schedule tasks on the system. Detecting this registry modification is important
  because it may indicate that an attacker has enabled the ability to add scheduled
  tasks to the system, which can be used to execute malicious code at specific times
  or intervals.'

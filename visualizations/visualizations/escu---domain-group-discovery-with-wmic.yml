title: ESCU - Domain Group Discovery With Wmic
description: This analytic looks for the execution of `wmic.exe` with command-line
  arguments utilized to query for domain groups. The arguments utilized in this command
  return a list of all domain groups. Red Teams and adversaries alike use wmic.exe
  to enumerate domain groups for situational awareness and Active Directory Discovery.

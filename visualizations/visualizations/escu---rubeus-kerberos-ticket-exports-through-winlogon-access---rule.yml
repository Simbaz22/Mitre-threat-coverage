title: ESCU - Rubeus Kerberos Ticket Exports Through Winlogon Access - Rule
description: The following analytic looks for a process accessing the winlogon.exe
  system process. The Splunk Threat Research team identified this behavior when using
  the Rubeus tool to monitor for and export kerberos tickets from memory. Before being
  able to export tickets. Rubeus will try to escalate privileges to SYSTEM by obtaining
  a handle to winlogon.exe before trying to monitor for kerberos tickets. Exporting
  tickets from memory is typically the first step for pass the ticket attacks. Red
  teams and adversaries alike may use the pass the ticket technique using stolen Kerberos
  tickets to move laterally within an environment, bypassing normal system access
  controls. Defenders should be aware that adversaries may customize the source code
  of Rubeus to potentially bypass this analytic.

title: ESCU - Exchange PowerShell Abuse via SSRF - Rule
description: "This analytic identifies suspicious behavior related to ProxyShell against\
  \ on-premise Microsoft Exchange servers. \nModification of this analytic is requried\
  \ to ensure fields are mapped accordingly. \nA suspicious event will have `PowerShell`,\
  \ the method `POST` and `autodiscover.json`. This is indicative of accessing PowerShell\
  \ on the back end of Exchange with SSRF. \nAn event will look similar to `POST /autodiscover/autodiscover.json\
  \ a=dsxvu@fnsso.flq/powershell/?X-Rps-CAT=VgEAVAdXaW5kb3d...` (abbreviated) \nReview\
  \ the source attempting to perform this activity against your environment. In addition,\
  \ review PowerShell logs and access recently granted to Exchange roles."

title: ESCU - Execution of File with Multiple Extensions - Rule
description: This search looks for processes launched from files that have double
  extensions in the file name. This is typically done to obscure the "real" file extension
  and make it appear as though the file being accessed is a data file, as opposed
  to executable content.

title: ESCU - Suspicious Process DNS Query Known Abuse Web Services - Rule
description: This analytic detects a suspicious process making a DNS query via known,
  abused text-paste web services, VoIP, instant messaging, and digital distribution
  platforms used to download external files. This technique is abused by adversaries,
  malware actors, and red teams to download a malicious file on the target host. This
  is a good TTP indicator for possible initial access techniques. A user will experience
  false positives if the following instant messaging is allowed or common applications
  like telegram or discord are allowed in the corporate network.

title: ESCU - Remote Process Instantiation via WinRM and PowerShell - Rule
description: This analytic looks for the execution of `powershell.exe` with arguments
  utilized to start a process on a remote endpoint by abusing the WinRM protocol.
  Specifically, this search looks for the abuse of the `Invoke-Command` commandlet.
  Red Teams and adversaries alike may abuse WinRM and `powershell.exe` for lateral
  movement and remote code execution.

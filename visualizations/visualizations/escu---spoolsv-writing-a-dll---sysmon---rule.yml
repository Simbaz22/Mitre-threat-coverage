title: ESCU - Spoolsv Writing a DLL - Sysmon - Rule
description: The following analytic identifies a `.dll` being written by `spoolsv.exe`.
  This was identified during our testing of CVE-2021-34527 previously(CVE-2021-1675)
  or PrintNightmare. Typically, this is not normal behavior for `spoolsv.exe` to write
  a `.dll`. Current POC code used will write the suspicious DLL to disk within a path
  of `\spool\drivers\x64\`. During triage, isolate the endpoint and review for source
  of exploitation. Capture any additional file modification events.

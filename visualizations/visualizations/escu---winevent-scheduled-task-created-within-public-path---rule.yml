title: ESCU - WinEvent Scheduled Task Created Within Public Path - Rule
description: '"The following query utilizes Windows Security EventCode 4698, `A scheduled
  task was created`, to identify suspicious tasks registered on Windows either via
  schtasks.exe OR TaskService with a command to be executed from a user writeable
  file path. The search will return the first time and last time the task was registered,
  as well as the `Command` to be executed, `Task Name`, `Author`, `Enabled`, and whether
  it is `Hidden` or not. schtasks.exe is natively found in `C:\Windows\system32` and
  `C:\Windows\syswow64`. The following DLL(s) are loaded when schtasks.exe or TaskService
  is launched -`taskschd.dll`. If found loaded by another process, it is possible
  a scheduled task is being registered within that process context in memory. Upon
  triage, identify the task scheduled source. Was it schtasks.exe or was it via TaskService.
  Review the job created and the Command to be executed. Capture any artifacts on
  disk and review. Identify any parallel processes within the same timeframe to identify
  source."'

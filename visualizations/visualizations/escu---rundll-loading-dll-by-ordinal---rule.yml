title: ESCU - RunDLL Loading DLL By Ordinal - Rule
description: The following analytic identifies rundll32.exe loading an export function
  by ordinal value. Adversaries may abuse rundll32.exe to proxy execution of malicious
  code. Using rundll32.exe, vice executing directly, may avoid triggering security
  tools that may not monitor execution of the rundll32.exe process because of allowlists
  or false positives from normal operations. Utilizing ordinal values makes it a bit
  more complicated for analysts to understand the behavior until the DLL is reviewed.

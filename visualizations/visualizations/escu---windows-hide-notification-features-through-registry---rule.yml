title: ESCU - Windows Hide Notification Features Through Registry - Rule
description: This analytic is to detect a suspicious registry modification to hide
  common windows notification feature from compromised host. This technique was seen
  in some ransomware family to add more impact to its payload that are visually seen
  by user aside from the encrypted files and ransomware notes. Even this a good anomaly
  detection, administrator may implement this changes for auditing or security reason.
  In this scenario filter is needed.

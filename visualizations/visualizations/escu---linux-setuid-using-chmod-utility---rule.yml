title: ESCU - Linux Setuid Using Chmod Utility - Rule
description: This analytic looks for suspicious chmod utility execution to enable
  SUID bit. This allows a user to temporarily gain root access, usually in order to
  run a program. For example, only the root account is allowed to change the password
  information contained in the password database; If the SUID bit appears as an s,
  the file's owner also has execute permission to the file; if it appears as an S,
  the file's owner does not have execute permission. The second specialty permission
  is the SGID, or set group id bit. It is similar to the SUID bit, except it can temporarily
  change group membership, usually to execute a program. The SGID bit is set if an
  s or an S appears in the group section of permissions.

title: ESCU - Linux Possible Append Cronjob Entry on Existing Cronjob File - Rule
description: This analytic looks for possible suspicious commandline that may use
  to append a code to any existing cronjob files for persistence or privilege escalation.
  This technique is commonly abused by malware, adversaries and red teamers to automatically
  execute their code within a existing or sometimes in normal cronjob script file.

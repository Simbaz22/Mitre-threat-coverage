title: ESCU - System Processes Run From Unexpected Locations - Rule
description: "This search looks for system processes that typically execute from `C:\\\
  Windows\\System32\\` or `C:\\Windows\\SysWOW64`.  This may indicate a malicious\
  \ process that is trying to hide as a legitimate process.\nThis detection utilizes\
  \ a lookup that is deduped `system32` and `syswow64` directories from Server 2016\
  \ and Windows 10.\nDuring triage, review the parallel processes - what process moved\
  \ the native Windows binary? identify any artifacts on disk and review. If a remote\
  \ destination is contacted, what is the reputation?"

title: ESCU - Resize ShadowStorage volume - Rule
description: The following analytics identifies the resizing of shadowstorage by ransomware
  malware to avoid the shadow volumes being made again. this technique is an alternative
  by ransomware attacker than deleting the shadowstorage which is known alert in defensive
  team. one example of ransomware that use this technique is CLOP ransomware where
  it drops a .bat file that will resize the shadowstorage to minimum size as much
  as possible

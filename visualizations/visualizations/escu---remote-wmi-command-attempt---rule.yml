title: ESCU - Remote WMI Command Attempt - Rule
description: The following analytic identifies usage of `wmic.exe` spawning a local
  or remote process, identified by the `node` switch. During triage, review parallel
  processes for additional commands executed. Look for any file modifications before
  and after `wmic.exe` execution. In addition, identify the remote endpoint and confirm
  execution or file modifications. Contain and isolate the endpoint as needed.

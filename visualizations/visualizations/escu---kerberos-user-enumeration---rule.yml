title: ESCU - Kerberos User Enumeration - Rule
description: The following analytic leverages Event Id 4768, A Kerberos authentication
  ticket (TGT) was requested, to identify one source endpoint trying to obtain an
  unusual number Kerberos TGT ticket for non existing users. This behavior could represent
  an adversary abusing the Kerberos protocol to perform a user enumeration attack
  against an Active Directory environment. When Kerberos is sent a TGT request with
  no preauthentication for an invalid username, it responds with KRB5KDC_ERR_C_PRINCIPAL_UNKNOWN
  or 0x6. Red teams and adversaries alike may abuse the Kerberos protocol to validate
  a list of users use them to perform further attacks.\ The detection calculates the
  standard deviation for each host and leverages the 3-sigma statistical rule to identify
  an unusual number requests. To customize this analytic, users can try different
  combinations of the `bucket` span time and the calculation of the `upperBound` field.

title: ESCU - Print Spooler Failed to Load a Plug-in - Rule
description: "The following analytic identifies driver load errors utilizing the Windows\
  \ PrintService Admin logs. This was identified during our testing of CVE-2021-34527\
  \ previously (CVE-2021-1675) or PrintNightmare. \nWithin the proof of concept code,\
  \ the following error will occur - \"The print spooler failed to load a plug-in\
  \ module C:\\Windows\\system32\\spool\\DRIVERS\\x64\\3\\meterpreter.dll, error code\
  \ 0x45A. See the event user data for context information.\" \nThe analytic is based\
  \ on file path and failure to load the plug-in. \nDuring triage, isolate the endpoint\
  \ and review for source of exploitation. Capture any additional file modification\
  \ events."

title: ESCU - Unknown Process Using The Kerberos Protocol - Rule
description: The following analytic identifies a process performing an outbound connection
  on port 88 used by default by the network authentication protocol Kerberos. Typically,
  on a regular Windows endpoint, only the lsass.exe process is the one tasked with
  connecting to the Kerberos Distribution Center to obtain Kerberos tickets. Identifying
  an unknown process using this protocol may be evidence of an adversary abusing the
  Kerberos protocol.

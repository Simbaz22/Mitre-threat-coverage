title: ESCU - Windows InstallUtil Credential Theft - Rule
description: "The following analytic identifies the Windows InstallUtil.exe binary\
  \ loading `vaultcli.dll` and Samlib.dll`. This technique may be used to execute\
  \ code to bypassing application control and capture credentials by utilizing a tool\
  \ like MimiKatz. \nWhen `InstallUtil.exe` is used in a malicous manner, the path\
  \ to an executable on the filesystem is typically specified. Take note of the parent\
  \ process. In a suspicious instance, this will be spawned from a non-standard process\
  \ like `Cmd.exe`, `PowerShell.exe` or `Explorer.exe`. \nIf used by a developer,\
  \ typically this will be found with multiple command-line switches/arguments and\
  \ spawn from Visual Studio. \nDuring triage review resulting network connections,\
  \ file modifications, and parallel processes. Capture any artifacts and review further."

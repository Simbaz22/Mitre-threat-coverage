title: ESCU - Linux Sudo OR Su Execution - Rule
description: This analytic is to detect the execution of sudo or su command in linux
  operating system. The "sudo" command allows a system administrator to delegate authority
  to give certain users (or groups of users) the ability to run some (or all) commands
  as root or another user while providing an audit trail of the commands and their
  arguments. This command is commonly abused by adversaries, malware author and red
  teamers to elevate privileges to the targeted host. This command can be executed
  by administrator for legitimate purposes or to execute process that need admin privileges,
  In this scenario filter is needed.

title: ESCU - Remote Process Instantiation via WinRM and Winrs - Rule
description: This analytic looks for the execution of `winrs.exe` with command-line
  arguments utilized to start a process on a remote endpoint. Red Teams and adversaries
  alike may abuse the WinRM protocol and this binary for lateral movement and remote
  code execution.

title: ESCU - Linux Iptables Firewall Modification - Rule
description: This analytic looks for suspicious commandline that modify the iptables
  firewall setting of a linux machine. This technique was seen in cyclopsblink malware
  where it modifies the firewall setting of the compromised machine to allow traffic
  to its tcp port that will be used to communicate with its C2 server.

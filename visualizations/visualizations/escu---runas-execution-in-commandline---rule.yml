title: ESCU - Runas Execution in CommandLine - Rule
description: This analytic look for a spawned runas.exe process with a administrator
  user option parameter. This parameter was abused by adversaries, malware author
  or even red teams to gain elevated privileges in target host. This is a good hunting
  query to figure out privilege escalation tactics that may used for different stages
  like lateral movement but take note that administrator may use this command in purpose
  so its better to see other event context before and after this analytic.

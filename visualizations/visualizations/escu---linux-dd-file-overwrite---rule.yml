title: ESCU - Linux DD File Overwrite - Rule
description: This analytic is to look for dd command to overwrite file. This technique
  was abused by adversaries or threat actor to destroy files or data on specific system
  or in a large number of host within network to interrupt host avilability, services
  and many more. This is also used to destroy data where it make the file irrecoverable
  by forensic techniques through overwriting files, data or local and remote drives.

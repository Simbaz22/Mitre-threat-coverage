title: ESCU - Windows Multiple Users Remotely Failed To Authenticate From Host - Rule
description: "The following analytic identifies a source host failing to authenticate\
  \ against a remote host with 30 unique users. This behavior could represent an adversary\
  \ performing a Password Spraying attack against an Active Directory environment\
  \ to obtain initial access or elevate privileges. Active Directory environments\
  \ can be very different depending on the organization. Users should test this detection\
  \ and customize the arbitrary threshold when needed. Event 4625 documents each and\
  \ every failed attempt to logon to the local computer. This event generates on domain\
  \ controllers, member servers, and workstations. Logon Type 3 describes an remote\
  \ authentication attempt.\nThis logic can be used for real time security monitoring\
  \ as well as threat hunting exercises. This detection will trigger on the host that\
  \ is the target of the password spraying attack. This could be a domain controller\
  \ as well as a member server or workstation.\nThe analytics returned fields allow\
  \ analysts to investigate the event further by providing fields like source process\
  \ name, source account and attempted user accounts."

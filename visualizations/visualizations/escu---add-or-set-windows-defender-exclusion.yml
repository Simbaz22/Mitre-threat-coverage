description: This analytic will identify a suspicious process command-line related
  to Windows Defender exclusion feature. This command is abused by adversaries, malware
  authors and red teams to bypass Windows Defender Antivirus products by excluding
  folder path, file path, process and extensions. From its real time or schedule scan
  to execute their malicious code. This is a good indicator for defense evasion and
  to look further for events after this behavior.

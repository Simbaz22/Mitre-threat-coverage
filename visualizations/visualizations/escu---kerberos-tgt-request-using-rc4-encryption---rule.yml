title: ESCU - Kerberos TGT Request Using RC4 Encryption - Rule
description: The following analytic leverages Event 4768, A Kerberos authentication
  ticket (TGT) was requested, to identify a TGT request with encryption type 0x17,
  or RC4-HMAC. This encryption type is no longer utilized by newer systems and could
  represent evidence of an OverPass The Hash attack. Similar to Pass The Hash, OverPass
  The Hash is a form of credential theft that allows adversaries to move laterally
  or consume resources in a target network. Leveraging this attack, an adversary who
  has stolen the NTLM hash of a valid domain account is able to authenticate to the
  Kerberos Distribution Center(KDC) on behalf of the legitimate account and obtain
  a Kerberos TGT ticket. Depending on the privileges of the compromised account, this
  ticket may be used to obtain unauthorized access to systems and other network resources.

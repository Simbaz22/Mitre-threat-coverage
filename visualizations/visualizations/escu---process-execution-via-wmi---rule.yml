title: ESCU - Process Execution via WMI - Rule
description: The following analytic identifies `WmiPrvSE.exe` spawning a process.
  This typically occurs when a process is instantiated from a local or remote process
  using `wmic.exe`. During triage, review parallel processes for suspicious behavior
  or commands executed. Review the process and command-line spawning from `wmiprvse.exe`.
  Contain and remediate the endpoint as necessary.

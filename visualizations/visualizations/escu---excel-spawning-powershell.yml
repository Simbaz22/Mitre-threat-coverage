title: ESCU - Excel Spawning PowerShell
description: The following detection identifies Microsoft Excel spawning PowerShell.
  Typically, this is not common behavior and not default with Excel.exe. Excel.exe
  will generally be found in the following path `C:\Program Files\Microsoft Office\root\Office16`
  (version will vary). PowerShell spawning from Excel.exe is common for a spearphishing
  attachment and is actively used. Albeit, the command executed will most likely be
  encoded and captured via another detection. During triage, review parallel processes
  and identify any files that may have been written.

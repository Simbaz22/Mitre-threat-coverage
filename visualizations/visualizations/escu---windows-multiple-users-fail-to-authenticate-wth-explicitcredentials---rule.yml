title: ESCU - Windows Multiple Users Fail To Authenticate Wth ExplicitCredentials
  - Rule
description: "The following analytic identifies a source user failing to authenticate\
  \ with 30 unique users using explicit credentials on a host. This behavior could\
  \ represent an adversary performing a Password Spraying attack against an Active\
  \ Directory environment to obtain initial access or elevate privileges. Active Directory\
  \ environments can be very different depending on the organization. Users should\
  \ test this detection and customize the arbitrary threshold when needed. Event 4648\
  \ is generated when a process attempts an account logon by explicitly specifying\
  \ that accounts credentials. This event generates on domain controllers, member\
  \ servers, and workstations.\nThis logic can be used for real time security monitoring\
  \ as well as threat hunting exercises. This detection will trigger on the potenfially\
  \ malicious host, perhaps controlled via a trojan or operated by an insider threat,\
  \ from where a password spraying attack is being executed.\nThe analytics returned\
  \ fields allow analysts to investigate the event further by providing fields like\
  \ source account, attempted user accounts and the endpoint were the behavior was\
  \ identified."

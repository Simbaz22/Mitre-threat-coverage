title: ESCU - Kerberos Pre-Authentication Flag Disabled with PowerShell - Rule
description: The following analytic utilizes PowerShell Script Block Logging (EventCode=4104)
  to identify the execution of the `Set-ADAccountControl` commandlet with specific
  parameters. `Set-ADAccountControl` is part of the Active Directory PowerShell module
  used to manage Windows Active Directory networks. As the name suggests, `Set-ADAccountControl`
  is used to modify User Account Control values for an Active Directory domain account.
  With the appropiate parameters, Set-ADAccountControl allows adversaries to disable
  Kerberos Pre-Authentication for an account to to easily perform a brute force attack
  against the user's password offline leveraging the ASP REP Roasting technique. Red
  Teams and adversaries alike who have obtained privileges in an Active Directory
  network may use this technique as a backdoor or a way to escalate privileges.

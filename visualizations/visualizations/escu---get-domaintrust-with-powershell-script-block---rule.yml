title: ESCU - Get-DomainTrust with PowerShell Script Block - Rule
description: "The following analytic utilizes PowerShell Script Block Logging (EventCode=4104)\
  \ to identify suspicious PowerShell execution. Script Block Logging captures the\
  \ command sent to PowerShell, the full command to be executed. Upon enabling, logs\
  \ will output to Windows event logs. Dependent upon volume, enable on critical endpoints\
  \ or all. \nThis analytic identifies Get-DomainTrust from PowerView in order to\
  \ gather domain trust information. \nDuring triage, review parallel processes using\
  \ an EDR product or 4688 events. It will be important to understand the timeline\
  \ of events around this activity. Review the entire logged PowerShell script block."

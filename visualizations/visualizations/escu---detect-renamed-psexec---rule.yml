title: ESCU - Detect Renamed PSExec - Rule
description: The following analytic identifies renamed instances of `PsExec.exe` being
  utilized on an endpoint. Most instances, it is highly probable to capture `Psexec.exe`
  or other SysInternal utility usage with the command-line argument of `-accepteula`.
  During triage, validate this is the legitimate version of `PsExec` by reviewing
  the PE metadata. In addition, review parallel processes for further suspicious behavior.

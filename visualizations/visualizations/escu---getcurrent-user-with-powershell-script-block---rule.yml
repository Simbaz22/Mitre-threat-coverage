title: ESCU - GetCurrent User with PowerShell Script Block - Rule
description: The following analytic utilizes PowerShell Script Block Logging (EventCode=4104)
  to identify the execution of the `GetCurrent` method of the WindowsIdentity .NET
  class. This method returns an object that represents the current Windows user. Red
  Teams and adversaries may leverage this method to identify the logged user on a
  compromised endpoint for situational awareness and Active Directory Discovery.

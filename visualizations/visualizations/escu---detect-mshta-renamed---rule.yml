title: ESCU - Detect mshta renamed - Rule
description: The following analytic identifies renamed instances of mshta.exe executing.
  Mshta.exe is natively found in C:\Windows\system32 and C:\Windows\syswow64. This
  analytic utilizes the internal name of the PE to identify if is the legitimate mshta
  binary. Further analysis should be performed to review the executed content and
  validation it is the real mshta.

title: ESCU - Windows DisableAntiSpyware Registry - Rule
description: The search looks for the Registry Key DisableAntiSpyware set to disable.
  This is consistent with Ryuk infections across a fleet of endpoints. This particular
  behavior is typically executed when an ransomware actor gains access to an endpoint
  and beings to perform execution. Usually, a batch (.bat) will be executed and multiple
  registry and scheduled task modifications will occur. During triage, review parallel
  processes and identify any further file modifications. Endpoint should be isolated.

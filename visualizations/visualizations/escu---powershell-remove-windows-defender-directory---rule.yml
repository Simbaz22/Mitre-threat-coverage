title: ESCU - Powershell Remove Windows Defender Directory - Rule
description: This analytic will identify a suspicious PowerShell command used to delete
  the Windows Defender folder. This technique was seen used by the WhisperGate malware
  campaign where it used Nirsofts advancedrun.exe to gain administrative privileges
  to then execute a PowerShell command to delete the Windows Defender folder. This
  is a good indicator the offending process is trying corrupt a Windows Defender installation.

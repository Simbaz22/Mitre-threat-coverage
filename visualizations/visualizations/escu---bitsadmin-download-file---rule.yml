title: ESCU - BITSAdmin Download File - Rule
description: The following query identifies Microsoft Background Intelligent Transfer
  Service utility `bitsadmin.exe` using the `transfer` parameter to download a remote
  object. In addition, look for `download` or `upload` on the command-line, the switches
  are not required to perform a transfer. Capture any files downloaded. Review the
  reputation of the IP or domain used. Typically once executed, a follow on command
  will be used to execute the dropped file. Note that the network connection or file
  modification events related will not spawn or create from `bitsadmin.exe`, but the
  artifacts will appear in a parallel process of `svchost.exe` with a command-line
  similar to `svchost.exe -k netsvcs -s BITS`. It's important to review all parallel
  and child processes to capture any behaviors and artifacts. In some suspicious and
  malicious instances, BITS jobs will be created. You can use `bitsadmin /list /verbose`
  to list out the jobs during investigation.

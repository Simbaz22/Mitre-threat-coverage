title: ESCU - Rundll32 Control RunDLL Hunt - Rule
description: The following hunting detection identifies rundll32.exe with `control_rundll`
  within the command-line, loading a .cpl or another file type. Developed in relation
  to CVE-2021-40444. Rundll32.exe can also be used to execute Control Panel Item files
  (.cpl) through the undocumented shell32.dll functions Control_RunDLL and Control_RunDLLAsUser.
  Double-clicking a .cpl file also causes rundll32.exe to execute. \ This is written
  to be a bit more broad by not including .cpl. \ During triage, review parallel processes
  to identify any further suspicious behavior.

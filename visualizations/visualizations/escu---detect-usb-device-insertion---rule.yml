title: ESCU - Detect USB device insertion - Rule
description: 'WARNING, this detection has been marked deprecated by the Splunk Threat
  Research team, this means that it will no longer be maintained or supported. If
  you have any questions feel free to email us at: research@splunk.com. The search
  is used to detect hosts that generate Windows Event ID 4663 for successful attempts
  to write to or read from a removable storage and Event ID 4656 for failures, which
  occurs when a USB drive is plugged in. In this scenario we are querying the Change_Analysis
  data model to look for Windows Event ID 4656 or 4663 where the priority of the affected
  host is marked as high in the ES Assets and Identity Framework.'
